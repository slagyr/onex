&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-27/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Panel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prep work I did, planning and drawing the electrical schematic, was invaluable.  The actually wiring, although detailed and time consuming, wasn’t as hard as I feared.  There was some learning curve.  For example, crimping the red (smallest) terminals with the red crimper setting is something I learned to avoid.  Doing so had a tendency to cut the wires inside the terminal.  Several wires had to be redone.  Fortunately I was testing each wire, where possible, before installation.  Over a dozen wire terminals had to be redone.  So I used the blue (14 -18 AWG) crimper for even the smallest wires and terminals.  They held tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-27/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Inside Wires&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The firewall forward wiring was just as complicated as the wiring on the inside.  There’s a 1/2” firewall pass-though for all the wires that need go from inside to out, or visa-versa.  I had thought that’d be plenty big.  Not so.  About half way through wiring the forward side of the firewall, I couldn’t pass any more wires through the hole.  The only way to continue was by removing the inner fiberglass sleeve of the pass-though.  That essentially doubled the volume of wires that would fit.  The hole is so packed full, and there’s a gel I have yet to apply that will fully seal it, so I’m confident it’s an acceptable compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on advise, I installed an over voltage module that’ll cut our the alternator should it misbehave.  Of course I wanted to test it.  So I turned power on, fliped the alternator switch, and with two 9V batteries in series (the OV module has a threshold of 16V) I put 18V on the alternator contactor leads, and …. click.  It worked… or maybe not.  I tried again but the alternator contactor wouldn’t close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called BandC tech support and he warned that the contactor can weld themselves shut when arcing occurs.  Well the 18V definitely did arc!  It turned out to be faulty wire on the alternator switch.  It was one of those wires I had crimped with the red crimper.  It must have been nearly cut by the terminal such that the arc melted the tiny connection that was being made.  Wire repaired, I called back tech support and asked how to test it without arching.  He said “Your test is good.  Alternators can throw big arcs.  Use the two 9V batteries again.”  So I did.  It arced.  And the circuit breaker popped, exactly as it should.  Baller!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-27/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Engine Wires&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next milestone is to fire up the engine.  Here’s my todo list before that’ll happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;install and wire stick handle / push to talk button&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;connect oil pressure tube to sensor (parts still on order)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reinstall fuel tank and connect fuel level sensor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;test fuel flow (should get at least 10 gallons/hr)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;install new oil sump kit with filter that I decided to get from Sonex.  The AeroVee doesn’t use a filter by default?!?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content><summary type="html">Lo and behold… after five+ days of wiring, when I turned on the master switch for the first time, the avionics came alive!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Tangled</title><link href="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/09/22/tangled.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tangled" /><published>2017-09-22T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-09-22T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/09/22/tangled</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/09/22/tangled.html">&lt;p&gt;Chaos!  So many components.  So many wires.  So little room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting our the instrument panel was not as bad as I feared.  The only tools I required was the Dremmel cutting wheel, drill bits, and files.  I think it turned out simple and quite user friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-22/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Instrument Panel Cutout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That carbon fiber vinyl adds a nice (dark) effect.  You can see I was short one circuit breaker.  It arrived and I’ve since filled that hole.  Then I learned that one of those circuit breakers is not needed.  Oops!  The EMS get’s it’s power from the display.  I’m just gonna leave it in the panel.  Don’t tell anyone it’s not connected to anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-22/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Instrument Panel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there’s all that stuff that goes into the instrument panel.  But then there’s all this stuff that is part of the instruments but doesn’t go IN the panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;EMS with three big cabler harnesses that stick out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transponder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comm box&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Backup battery&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fuel level sensor box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more but this is all the stuff that I had planned to install behind the instrument panel.  I fabricated a shelf that would go right behind the panel and in front of the fuel tank.  It’s a place to mount all the components and keep the wires in place.  I thought I could fit everything in there, with a couple components underneath.  But once I put it in place in the fuselage, I noticed that the harnesses of the comm and transponder stuck out the side a bit too far.  The glaresheild wouldn’t be able to fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-22/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dash Design, Bad&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EMS, with its big cables, had to go.  But where?  Eventually I decided there was room on the front right side of the fuselage where my leg would not really interfere with anything.  Since I was at it, I felt like this would be a better home for the backup battery and fuel sensor box, which were originally mounted upsidedown underneath the intrument panel.  Fabricating that mount took almost a full day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that this is where I decided to place the main electric bus and avionics bus (upside down), along with my Stratus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-22/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Side Panels&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, these things also got done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CHT temp probes installed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;EGT probes installed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GPS antenna installed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VHF antenna installed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contactors, master and alternator, mounted to firewall&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Side engine baffles modified with nutplates so they can be removed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hired welder to weld bushing to intake manifold for MAP sensor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Completed most small wiring local to instrument panel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Family vacation in Page, AZ.  :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content><summary type="html">Chaos!  So many components.  So many wires.  So little room.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Oil and Water</title><link href="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/09/13/oil-and-water.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Oil and Water" /><published>2017-09-13T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-09-13T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/09/13/oil-and-water</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/09/13/oil-and-water.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;oil-separator&quot;&gt;Oil Separator&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My kit came with an oil separator, the black cylinder attached to the firewall.  It’s possible I added it to my order as an extra because many other builders don’t seem to have one.  As I understand, it minimizes loss of oil, especially when flying inverted.  Any oil, or vapor, that comes out of the top of the engine get routed through a tube to the separator.  There a ball bearing in the top that prevents oil from flowing back to the top of the engine when inverted.  Oil collects at the bottom of the separator where it can flow back into the bottom of the engine (steel braided tube).  Vapor escapes through the black vent tube out the bottom of the plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-13/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Oil Separator&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fuel-system-water-test&quot;&gt;Fuel System Water Test&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture below shows the final part of the fuel system; the transducer (to measure flow) and line from the tank.  My choice of location for the gascolator was both good and bad.  On the front of the firewall it fits great with the drain easily accessible between the exhaust pipes, smooth run to the aeroinjector, and it’s mounted firmly to the vertical angle strut.  Unfortunately, I didn’t foresee that the angle strut would prevent me from attaching anything but straight fitting on the inside of the fuselage.  I had to order some AN parts to extend the line far enough that I could attach the transducer.  Since it ended up right between the pedals, I added a guard plate to hold it secure should my feet kick it accidentally.  Later I added a vertical angle to protect the line to the tank too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the fuel system components in place, it was time to take it apart and add fuel lube/sealant to the threads of all the AN unions, bends, reducers, etc.  Once that was done, I filled the tank with water to check for leaks.  There were a couple in the burp elimination lines that were easily fixed by tightening the caps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple things surprised me.  First was the aeroinjector dripping continuously.  When I opened the throttle a stream came out of it.  Pulling the mixture closed stopped it.  The idea of fuel flowing out of the injector is a bit scary, even if only right before engine start when the mixture has to be open.  I asked Denny Myrick about it and he pointed me to the flight manual that warns about this situation and advises “Do Not delay engine start”.  Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, when I filled the tank to the brim, water started flowing out of the burp elimination drain, and it didn’t stop even when the water level dropped beneath the vent on top of the tank.  The drain that goes out the bottom of the plane is the lowest point in the fuel lines.  So when the fuel level reaches the vent on the top of the tank, a negative pressure can start pulling the fuel out the drain and there’s nothing to stop it, except some positive air pressure.  I put my mouth in the fill hole, sealing it with my cheeks and blew.  Water shot out the drain and the flow stopped.  Luckily it was just water.  I don’t fancy doing that with a tank full of 100LL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-13/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Interior Fuel Connection&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;firewall-electronics&quot;&gt;Firewall Electronics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the firewall I mounted the battery, grounding block, and electrical pass-through.  It’s hard to know what’s the best layout for the firewall.  I’m trying to be strategic.  The electrical pass-through is right next to a engine mount arm to which I can easily run wires with zip-ties.  The negative lead of the battery is an inch or two away from the grounding block which is also right next to the engine mount arm. It’s like an electrical wire highway and parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What remains to be mounted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;master contactor/solenoid&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;voltage protection contactor/solenoid&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;voltage regulator&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;oil pressure sensor (still waiting for line and connecting hardware to arrive)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of room for all this but I’m stalling to see if any inspiration helps me find a good location for it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-13/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Firewall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been hesitating to start installing avionics and running electrical wires, but I’m running out of other things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;135-pilot-training&quot;&gt;135 Pilot Training&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started training to be a 135 charter pilot with &lt;a href=&quot;http://eliteflightjets.com/&quot;&gt;Elite Flight Jets&lt;/a&gt; today.  I continue training tomorrow so work on the OneX is taking a back seat.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Oil Separator</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Baffles</title><link href="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/09/08/baffles.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Baffles" /><published>2017-09-08T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-09-08T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/09/08/baffles</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/09/08/baffles.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;engine-baffles&quot;&gt;Engine Baffles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I never have to build engine baffles again.  ‘Nuf said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-08/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Baffles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The K&amp;amp;N RC-1980 air filter seems to do the trick.  It attaches with a simple ring clamp and can be installed in such a manner so as to not interfere with the cowling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-08/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;K&amp;amp;N Air Filter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Engine Baffles</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Firewall</title><link href="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/09/07/firewall.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Firewall" /><published>2017-09-07T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-09-07T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/09/07/firewall</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/09/07/firewall.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;exhaust&quot;&gt;Exhaust&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kit exhaust pipes are longer than needed.  They rest at an angle and I thought it’d look good to have them parallel with the fuselage, yet sticking out a bit to make sure the exhaust exits cleanly.  The cut line was a bit trikcy to get right, and then cutting with the grinding wheel was an experience that reminded me of the Orange County Choppers show where they fabricated choppers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-07/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Exhaust&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;firewall&quot;&gt;Firewall&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the firewall I added the ignitions, oil seperator, and battery (exact location still pending).  There’s still a few things to add but there should be plenty of room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-07/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Firewall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;baffles&quot;&gt;Baffles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hiking this morning with Angelique, I had a bit of energy the afternoon to get started on the baffles for the engine.  Sonex provided a lazer but kit, but the fit is rough there’s plenty of modifications to be made.  These baffles feel a bit hackish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-07/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Baffles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Exhaust</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Burp Elimination</title><link href="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/09/05/burp-elimination.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Burp Elimination" /><published>2017-09-05T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-09-05T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/09/05/burp-elimination</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/09/05/burp-elimination.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;cowling&quot;&gt;Cowling&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a great deal of time and care to get the cowling cut nicely.  Once it fit well, I added the camlocks (from an Aeroward kit) to fasten the top cowling to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seams between the two halves were crooked (unavoidably) and I couldn’t leave it like that.  I made some micro-paste with epoxy and micro-bubbles to fill in the seams (see the first picture) and sanded them flush.  It turned out much cleaner I think.  There was also some sag in the bottom corners because I didn’t notice when I lined up the hinge rivets.  That part was probably a two man job but I did it solo.  So I reinforced the inside of the bottom corners with maybe 10 layers of fiberglass.  When dry, I sanded bottoms flush with the fuselage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-05/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Colwing Patchup&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-05/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cowling Complete&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;throttle--mixture-cables&quot;&gt;Throttle &amp;amp; Mixture Cables&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plans leave it up the builder how to run the throttle and mixture cables.  Not wanting to drill excessive holes in the longerons and support angles, I fabricated some brackets and mounted them to existing holes.  The AirWard kit came with some nice cable-safe firewall pass-throughs to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I drilled the hole for the gascolator line, I butchered that part of the firewall.  The steel is hard to drill, but very bendy.  The large drill bits catch and twist the thin steel.  So for the throttle and mixture pass-throughs, I added aluminum plates on the inside and out. This reinforcement made very clean holes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob helped me guide the cables through the bracket holes in which I had embedded rubber grommets.  This was an ordeal because the grommets kept popping out and we had to pull the cables out, re-insert the grommets, and try again.  The cables are a bit thicker where they bend and that’s where the brackets located, at the bends.  We eventually got it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-05/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cable Run&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning I connected all the cables to the controls and the AeroInjector.  The throttle was straight forward.  The mixture cable had a couple gotchas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, to cut the line to size you need to pull the inner cable out.  The mixture cable comes with the warning tag that says something like: “Do not poll knob out more then 3 inches or a ball bearning will pop out and the control will not function.”  Of course the first time I saw that I pulled it more than 3” and a tiny ball bearing did indeed pop out, and the knob no longer functioned.  I managed to find the ball bearing, get it back in and the the knob worked once again.  So today I was careful to catch the ball and no harm done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, with the mixture cable attached to the AeroInjector, the inner wire had a tendency to bend when I push the mixture full-rich or pull it (lean it), and the arm would not fully open or close.  With a washer to separate the wire from the mixture arm, and careful adjustment of the lock nut, the wire can swivel and avoid the bend.  Add to that some safety wire to hold the outer cable in place, and it resists tendency to bend even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-05/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AeroInjector Cables&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fuel-lines--burp-elimination&quot;&gt;Fuel Lines / Burp Elimination&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see in the next picture the AirWard burp elimination system.  Aluminum tube running all along the edge of the firewall, an extra flex tube running to the AeroInjector, and a “T” junction that penetrates the firewall and connects to the fuel tank vent.  The principle is that high line will allow any air bubbles to escape and since it’ll be filled with fuel, it’ll add extra pressure to the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-05/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Burp Elimination&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bending and flaring these aluminum tubes was a new experience.  Pipe bending, cutting, and flaring tools are fairly inexpensive.  Those adel clamps hole the lines in place nicely.  I had to cut an extra little hole in the bottom cowling for the vent tube.  When I tried the cowling on again, it was blocked by air filter (I had installed it earlier today) which was rubbing against the bottom of the cowling.  Sigh.  I trimmed the rubber tube that connects the AeroInjector to the intake manifold to no avail.  After googling the problem, other builders had resorted to alternative air filters.  So I ordered a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00062YOIG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;K&amp;amp;N RC-1980&lt;/a&gt; from Amazon.  Hopefully that works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the last two Oops fittings that go in the fuel tank.  A drain valve goes in one and the fuel level sensor will go in the other.&lt;/p&gt;

However, much progress has been made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sonex-build-visits&quot;&gt;Sonex Build Visits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday I went to visit Denny and Jim at Deer Valley airport to check out their builds.  It’s always fruitful to see how other people build their planes.  I got plenty of ideas for improving my build.  And I got a better sense of how to proceed with the engine and electronic components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim’s hangar was my first stop.  He’s been working on his Sonex for 12 years.  Maybe that’s because there are lots of distractions at the airport. At least three people stopped by within an hour to chat and check out the build.  Anyhow, Jim gave me a great tour and then got help from Denny to start up the engine and see how it ran.  Purred like a tiger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the walk to Denny’s hangar I got a special treat.  Hoa, another Sonex owner was cleaning his beautiful bird.  He proudly presented his vinyl wrap job, which is truly nice.  He outsourced it and paid less than half what a paint job costs.  I still want to do my own wrap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-08-30/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hoa's Sonex&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denny’s Sonex has been flying for 9 years.  He did a wonderful job building it and he’s put over 700 hours on it since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-08-30/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Denny's Sonex&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon after the visits, I did a bit of work on the wing fold.  I wanted to better understand how they connect and fold.  While looking at it, I notices some flat heads protruding where the outboard spar attaches.  That’s not good.  So I took it apart and cleaned it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, I pulled out AirWard’s fuel shutoff kit and began work.  But I couldn’t figure it out so I emailed Dave.  He helped me realize that there was a missing part that I was able to pick up at the hardware store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electrical-diagrams&quot;&gt;Electrical Diagrams&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received the Aircraft Wiring Guild over the week end and read it.  Although short, it spelled out a lot of things that were not obvious to me.  With what I learned, I was able to draw a couple schematics (below) of the electrical system I intend to build.  This was intense! Very details oriented.  What you can’t see is my spreadsheet detailing every wire; its gauge, ends points, terminators, and length.  It took about 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these, I was able to order all the wires, terminators, switches, and various electrical components I should need to wire everything together.  I fear it may take quite a while to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-08-30/4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Main Electrical&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-08-30/5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Avionics&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fuel-shutoff&quot;&gt;Fuel Shutoff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem with the fuel shutoff kits is that Sonex has recently stoped building tanks with builtin ports and is including their Oops fittings instead.  The Oops fitting is a threaded, flanged tube that has to be inserted from the inside of the tank.  With a nut on the outside and rubber washers in and out, the Oops fitting seems very secure.  But Dave, from AirWard, hadn’t updated his kit to accommodate the Oops fittings so I had to get a bit creative to make it work.  But it does work, nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-08-30/6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fuel Shutoff&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s two more kits for the fuel system.  The fuel system kit, which contains all the basic parts, and a kit to eliminate &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sonexbuilders.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&amp;amp;t=1139&amp;amp;start=10&quot;&gt;the infamous “Burp” symptom of the AeroInjector&lt;/a&gt;.  The instructions for the burp kit were mind boggling.  I emailed Dave some more.  Eventually, after reading all the fuel system instructions multiple times and drawing diagrams, the system made sense and I could visualize it.  Great!  But the fuel components can’t interfere with the cowling, which hasn’t been installed yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cowling&quot;&gt;Cowling&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fuel system is on hold so I can work on the cowling.  Cutting and sanding fiberglass…. fun.  It cuts like butter compared to metal, but fiberglass particles go everywhere (ichy), and the chemical smells can’t be healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project brings back painstaking memories of the windshield.  The cowlings have to be cut in multiple places.  Most annoying is the engine rocker covers that stick out the side on a OneX.  The cowling won’t fit into place without the engine cover cut out.  And you don’t know where to make the cutout without fitting the cowling into place.  So it’s another game of install as much as possible, make tiny cuts, uninstall, cut, repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did these on Monday (after watching the eclipse) and they can all be seen in the picture below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-08-23/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Engine Components&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aircraftwiringguide.com/&quot;&gt;Aircraft Wiring Guide by Marc Ausman&lt;/a&gt; book that I ordered from Lulu will help answer many of the questions.  It should arrive tomorrow.  I’ve also got an appointment to visit two other Sonex builders tomorrow morning, Denny Smith and Jim Armstrong.  I’m hoping I can get answers to my remaining questions from them and their builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, yesterday and today I worked on the outboard spars.  These are the main supports for the outer parts of the wings that fold up.  These were a little easier than the main spar but my experience allowed me to complete them much faster.  Bucking rivets is exhausting so I quite a bit earlier than normal today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The engine is mounted!  I recruited some help; specifically my friend Rob, my son Luka and his friends Caleb and David.  They were off to a high school football game so their friends Siri, Kayla, and Elly were over to eat first and car pool.  I had more help than I needed, at least I thought so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four of us guys lifted the engine while one helped line it up and insert bolts.  It took a few tries though.  The rubber grommets/bushings fit real tight and they were hard to get into place.  Then we realized that the bolts would only fit while the engine was off the mount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While pushing the engine in place, the plane kept rolling backwards.  Thankfully the girls where there.  They got behind the main spar and held the plane in place.  Everyone played a part and it was fortunate that they were all there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I swelled with a sence of accomplishment finally seeing the engine on the fuselage.  Special thanks goes out to my team of high spirited helpers.  Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-08-18/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Engine Mounted&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the engine mounted I can start to figure out where all the remaining controls, wires, cables, etc. need to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rear-spar&quot;&gt;Rear Spar&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While waiting on my engine helpers, I worked on some wing parts for a couple days.  The rear spar is now assembled.  Getting the subtle angled on the ends (not really visible here) was the only real tricky part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-08-18/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rear Spar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wing-ribs&quot;&gt;Wing Ribs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you see in the picture below is all the wing ribs for the inboard spar, and a couple for the outboard.  There’s more ribs, but all these were the same part number so I figured I’d work on them together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy was it tedious.  Mind-numbing.  16 nearly identical sets of parts each needing, clecoing, updrilling, de-burring, filing, scotchbriting, cleaning, and finally riveting.  What a relief when those were done…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-08-18/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wing Ribs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the wing parts are set aside for the time being.  I’ll start attaching them when I’m pretty much done working inside the fuselage so the wings don’t get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Engine Mounting</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Flaps Controls</title><link href="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/08/16/flaps-controls.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Flaps Controls" /><published>2017-08-16T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-08-16T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/08/16/flaps-controls</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/08/16/flaps-controls.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;flaps-handle&quot;&gt;Flaps Handle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installed this yesterday.  Nothing much of interest to report.  I decided not to connect the rods so they wouldn’t get in the way when I work on the wings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-08-16/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flaps Control&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;elevator-trim&quot;&gt;Elevator Trim&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elevator trim arrived right when I finished the flaps. The cable has to be routed from the instrument panel to behind the trim lever where the two rods meet.  After considering my options, I drilled some holes in the side fuselage beams, stuck some rubber gromets in there and rand the cable.  I think it looks decent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-08-16/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Trim Routing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These springs hold the elevator in a neutral position, and they’re connected to trim cable on the right side of the picture.  I’ll have to reconfigure the wire tension when I figure out where the trim knob will be mounted.  And I realized that my forward spring hole won’t work since the rear spar has to go there.  So I’ll relocate that.&lt;/p&gt;
