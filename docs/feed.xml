Upon getting back I continued work on the wing-fold parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aileron-control-bells&quot;&gt;Aileron Control Bells&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see in the first picture how these swivel paddles (not sure real name) mount to plates at the end of the spars.  This half goes on the outboard spar (the part that folds up) and will be connected to the ailerons.  The inboard paddles will connect to the control stick and translate control inputs to the ailerons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had both halves done, I lined them up and noticed that the paddles didn’t line up well at all.  The ball bearings rested on the very edge of the opposing paddles.  I doubled checked the plans several times, but I had followed them correctly.  Eventually I decided the plans were wrong and I was able to solve the problem by drilling out some rivets and putting the outboard paddles on the top of the swivel bell instead of the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-10-19/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wing Fold Fix&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wing-fold-panels&quot;&gt;Wing Fold Panels&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the wing-halves meet, there are these plates that have soooo many rivets.  As I drilled, deburred and counter sunk all those holes, I had plenty of time to wonder why so many rivets would be needed.  You can see in the picture above that there’s not much structure to hold together; just two sheets. The best answer I could think of was: Why not?  The rivets do add strength to the layers and don’t add much weight.  But maybe it’s overkill.  Those extra rivers sure added a lot of labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-10-19/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wing Fold Installed&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before attaching the outboard spars, the plans have you install the ribs, skin, and fiberglass tips.  I was going to get the folding joint secured first to save workshop room, but the rear spar participates in the fold-locking mechanism so I have at least have to get the ribs attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I clecoed them all together I noticed that the inner most forward rib was about 1/8” shorter than the others.  There are spacers on almost all the ribs to make them equal length, but somehow the plans didn’t get it right… and no spacer was provided for this rib.  So again I went off script and made my own spacer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These assemblies are all riveted and bolted now.  Tomorrow I’ll see if I can get the spars attached and folding.&lt;/p&gt;

All the squawks have been addressed and were not necessarily what I suspected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rpms&quot;&gt;RPMs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swapping the RPM sensor lead to the other side of the Voltage regulator did the trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alternator-output&quot;&gt;Alternator Output&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wired up some extentions to the alternator and voltage regulator leads so I could measure with a voltmeter while I sat in the cockpit.  All signals are good.  Alternator is generating high voltage and the regulator is regulating.  I found that output is not great at the low RPMs at which I was initially running the engine.  When I got above 2,000 RPM, the alternator output was much more reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ignition&quot;&gt;Ignition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ignition timing needed adjusting.  Once I centered it, the engine ran MUCH smoother.  Currently I get about a 60-70 RPM drop when I turn off the magnetos and/or ignition.  Fine tuning is needed, but I may need to get in the air to figure out whether I need to retard or advance the timing.  Or maybe my mechanic will be able to tell on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;unsteady-rpms&quot;&gt;Unsteady RPMs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, I found, was a result of vibrations moving the throttle.  Tightening the friction solved the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;oil-leaks&quot;&gt;Oil Leaks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding the exact source of the leaks was not easy.  I tightened and resealed many parts before I found the actual source.  No more oil seeps out of the engine now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wing-ribs&quot;&gt;Wing Ribs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work on the wings resumes.  I attached the inboard wing ribs to the spar.  Am working on the wing fold ribs which are quite involved.  I had started these months ago but put them on hold.  Now I have a much clearer idea of how they fit in.&lt;/p&gt;

Below there’s a video of the event recorded by my son Luka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preparation&quot;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding fuel 1/2 gallons at a time, I marked the fuel level on the tank up to 3 gallons.  Sitting in the plane, I can only see up to 2 gallons but it could be useful in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AeroVee manual says to prime the oil first.  This involved removing 4 spark plugs, 1 from each cylinder, and making sure the oil pressure sensor reads an increase in pressure when running the starter.  Mine read 57 PSI before I touched the starter, and it never budged.  That’s not right!  Dynon support says it’s likely a faulty pressure sensor (Kavlico 150 PSI).  Apparently they’ve had a few similar reports with these sensors so they’re sending me a new one.  I had a spare “legacy” mechanical sensor so I connected that one and it worked.  No show stopper here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pulled the plane out to the basketball court again, chained it to the post, put the parking breaks on, and put chocks under the tires.  Who know what could happen and you can’t be too safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-10-05/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Test Location&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;first-engine-test&quot;&gt;First Engine Test&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luka came out to assist.  His job was to check for leaking fluids and film the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first try, the engine popped a few times.  Perhaps I was too gentle on the throttle, or perhaps the engine needed a few moments to stretch a bit before coming to life for the first time.  But it didn’t take long to get it running steady… and boy did it get windy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/237020116&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazing!  I’d never built an engine before.  It’s fascinating that a newb like me can put all those engine pieces together and get a working engine that starts on the first test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;squawks&quot;&gt;Squawks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll see in the video that once the engine is running, I’m checking all the sensors and performance.  Most everything worked great but there are a few problems I need to investigate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The RPM indicator showed 0 when I turned the alternator on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The battery didn’t charge and eventually died.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Although the magnetos worked great, the ignitions were intermittent.  When I turned the mags off, the engine would sputter and threaten to quit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The RPMs were a bit unsteady, tending to rise and fall without any change in throttle, except at idle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A small amount of oil leaked out from the oil cooler mount, drain bolt, and oil pump.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the plane back in the garage, I tightened some bolt to seal the oil leaks.  And with some quick research, I discovered that I may have connected the RPM sensor lead to the wrong terminal on the voltage regulator.  This may be the cause for most the other problems. I swapped the leads and we’ll see how that helps tomorrow.  When I reposition the AeroInjector, that may help with the sporadic RPMs.  I’ll report in a later blog.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Fired up the engine for the first time today.

Most experimental aircraft accidents occur in the first few hours of flight due to fuel flow problems.  So it’s important to test it.  Here’s how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Convention says that an engine needs 0.55 lbs of fuel per hour for each HP, at maximum power.  My AeroVee is 80HP, so that’s 44lbs per hours.  Each gallon of 100LL weights 6 pounds so that 7.33 gallons / hr, and we measure the flow at the point where the fuel enters the carburetor, or AeroInjector in my case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the OneX has a gravity fed fuel system (no pump), the FAA mandates a safety factor of 150%. I should see 11 gal/hr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this fuel demand is typically on take off where the engine is high.  It’s best to perform the test at 5° above the maximum climb attitude.  I couldn’t find any documentation for OneX climb angles, but if you consider short field take offs where the highest climb rate is required, common procedure is an initial climb rate of 10° until you clear any obstacle, and then you shallow the climb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, I should see a 11 gallons per hour flowing out at the AeroInjector with the aircraft at a 15° nose-up attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does one get an unfinished plane into a 15° nose up attitude?  At rest it sits at 6° because I have a tail dragger. On Sunday I built a ramp/platform for the main gears.  I needed help so it was fortunate that Luka has some friends over for homework.  Together we were able to push it up there.  That got us 12°, but it was a bit precarious and I wasn’t comfortable putting any more bricks.  I rant the test anyway and measured 6.6 gal/hr.  Out of the gascolator I got 12.9 gal/hr but that doesn’t really count, so it didn’t pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized later that I had the gas tank sealed and the vent doesn’t open unless there’s airflow.  Perhaps there was a negative pressure building in the tank.  My mechanic, Tony, also told me I need to put more than 1 gallons in the tank… at least two or three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-10-04/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Plane On Ramp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little trigonometry says I need to raise the main gears about 2’ to get 15°.  Rather than raise the main gear more, I figured I could dig a hole and lower the tail into it.  Digging a hole in Arizona is way harder than diging a hole in Illinois by the way.  But I got one about a foot and a half deep.  Then I pushed the plane up a little ramp and this yielded 15.6°.  I was hoping for 20° but this was good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-10-04/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Plane in Hole&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuring the flow again, with the tank open and 3 gallons in the tank, I measured 6.25 gal / hr.  Oh no!  There’s something seriously wrong!  After pondering the problem for a long while, I realized that the fuel had to flow up hill from the gascolator to get to the injector.  The injector was angled way up due to the silicone hose and it’s angle could easily be adjusted with different hose.  So I repositioned the fuel line to a point at which I could lower the injector input and measured 11.5 gal/hr. Whew! That made all the difference.  I took a few more measurements, let the tank drain, and measured the “unusable fuel” remaining in the tank, about 1/8 of a gallon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ordered some new hoses to explore a few options.  The trick is getting the air filter to attach to the AeroInjector without interfering with the lower cowling.  But now I know where the fuel intake has to be to get the flow required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-27/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Panel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prep work I did, planning and drawing the electrical schematic, was invaluable.  The actually wiring, although detailed and time consuming, wasn’t as hard as I feared.  There was some learning curve.  For example, crimping the red (smallest) terminals with the red crimper setting is something I learned to avoid.  Doing so had a tendency to cut the wires inside the terminal.  Several wires had to be redone.  Fortunately I was testing each wire, where possible, before installation.  Over a dozen wire terminals had to be redone.  So I used the blue (14 -18 AWG) crimper for even the smallest wires and terminals.  They held tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-27/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Inside Wires&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The firewall forward wiring was just as complicated as the wiring on the inside.  There’s a 1/2” firewall pass-though for all the wires that need go from inside to out, or visa-versa.  I had thought that’d be plenty big.  Not so.  About half way through wiring the forward side of the firewall, I couldn’t pass any more wires through the hole.  The only way to continue was by removing the inner fiberglass sleeve of the pass-though.  That essentially doubled the volume of wires that would fit.  The hole is so packed full, and there’s a gel I have yet to apply that will fully seal it, so I’m confident it’s an acceptable compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on advise, I installed an over voltage module that’ll cut our the alternator should it misbehave.  Of course I wanted to test it.  So I turned power on, fliped the alternator switch, and with two 9V batteries in series (the OV module has a threshold of 16V) I put 18V on the alternator contactor leads, and …. click.  It worked… or maybe not.  I tried again but the alternator contactor wouldn’t close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called BandC tech support and he warned that the contactor can weld themselves shut when arcing occurs.  Well the 18V definitely did arc!  It turned out to be faulty wire on the alternator switch.  It was one of those wires I had crimped with the red crimper.  It must have been nearly cut by the terminal such that the arc melted the tiny connection that was being made.  Wire repaired, I called back tech support and asked how to test it without arching.  He said “Your test is good.  Alternators can throw big arcs.  Use the two 9V batteries again.”  So I did.  It arced.  And the circuit breaker popped, exactly as it should.  Baller!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-27/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Engine Wires&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next milestone is to fire up the engine.  Here’s my todo list before that’ll happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;install and wire stick handle / push to talk button&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;connect oil pressure tube to sensor (parts still on order)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reinstall fuel tank and connect fuel level sensor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;test fuel flow (should get at least 10 gallons/hr)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;install new oil sump kit with filter that I decided to get from Sonex.  The AeroVee doesn’t use a filter by default?!?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content><summary type="html">Lo and behold… after five+ days of wiring, when I turned on the master switch for the first time, the avionics came alive!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Tangled</title><link href="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/09/22/tangled.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tangled" /><published>2017-09-22T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-09-22T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/09/22/tangled</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/09/22/tangled.html">&lt;p&gt;Chaos!  So many components.  So many wires.  So little room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting our the instrument panel was not as bad as I feared.  The only tools I required was the Dremmel cutting wheel, drill bits, and files.  I think it turned out simple and quite user friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-22/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Instrument Panel Cutout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That carbon fiber vinyl adds a nice (dark) effect.  You can see I was short one circuit breaker.  It arrived and I’ve since filled that hole.  Then I learned that one of those circuit breakers is not needed.  Oops!  The EMS get’s it’s power from the display.  I’m just gonna leave it in the panel.  Don’t tell anyone it’s not connected to anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-22/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Instrument Panel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there’s all that stuff that goes into the instrument panel.  But then there’s all this stuff that is part of the instruments but doesn’t go IN the panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;EMS with three big cabler harnesses that stick out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transponder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comm box&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Backup battery&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fuel level sensor box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more but this is all the stuff that I had planned to install behind the instrument panel.  I fabricated a shelf that would go right behind the panel and in front of the fuel tank.  It’s a place to mount all the components and keep the wires in place.  I thought I could fit everything in there, with a couple components underneath.  But once I put it in place in the fuselage, I noticed that the harnesses of the comm and transponder stuck out the side a bit too far.  The glaresheild wouldn’t be able to fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-22/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dash Design, Bad&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EMS, with its big cables, had to go.  But where?  Eventually I decided there was room on the front right side of the fuselage where my leg would not really interfere with anything.  Since I was at it, I felt like this would be a better home for the backup battery and fuel sensor box, which were originally mounted upsidedown underneath the intrument panel.  Fabricating that mount took almost a full day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that this is where I decided to place the main electric bus and avionics bus (upside down), along with my Stratus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-22/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Side Panels&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, these things also got done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CHT temp probes installed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;EGT probes installed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GPS antenna installed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VHF antenna installed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contactors, master and alternator, mounted to firewall&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Side engine baffles modified with nutplates so they can be removed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hired welder to weld bushing to intake manifold for MAP sensor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Completed most small wiring local to instrument panel&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My kit came with an oil separator, the black cylinder attached to the firewall.  It’s possible I added it to my order as an extra because many other builders don’t seem to have one.  As I understand, it minimizes loss of oil, especially when flying inverted.  Any oil, or vapor, that comes out of the top of the engine get routed through a tube to the separator.  There a ball bearing in the top that prevents oil from flowing back to the top of the engine when inverted.  Oil collects at the bottom of the separator where it can flow back into the bottom of the engine (steel braided tube).  Vapor escapes through the black vent tube out the bottom of the plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-13/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Oil Separator&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fuel-system-water-test&quot;&gt;Fuel System Water Test&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture below shows the final part of the fuel system; the transducer (to measure flow) and line from the tank.  My choice of location for the gascolator was both good and bad.  On the front of the firewall it fits great with the drain easily accessible between the exhaust pipes, smooth run to the aeroinjector, and it’s mounted firmly to the vertical angle strut.  Unfortunately, I didn’t foresee that the angle strut would prevent me from attaching anything but straight fitting on the inside of the fuselage.  I had to order some AN parts to extend the line far enough that I could attach the transducer.  Since it ended up right between the pedals, I added a guard plate to hold it secure should my feet kick it accidentally.  Later I added a vertical angle to protect the line to the tank too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the fuel system components in place, it was time to take it apart and add fuel lube/sealant to the threads of all the AN unions, bends, reducers, etc.  Once that was done, I filled the tank with water to check for leaks.  There were a couple in the burp elimination lines that were easily fixed by tightening the caps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple things surprised me.  First was the aeroinjector dripping continuously.  When I opened the throttle a stream came out of it.  Pulling the mixture closed stopped it.  The idea of fuel flowing out of the injector is a bit scary, even if only right before engine start when the mixture has to be open.  I asked Denny Myrick about it and he pointed me to the flight manual that warns about this situation and advises “Do Not delay engine start”.  Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, when I filled the tank to the brim, water started flowing out of the burp elimination drain, and it didn’t stop even when the water level dropped beneath the vent on top of the tank.  The drain that goes out the bottom of the plane is the lowest point in the fuel lines.  So when the fuel level reaches the vent on the top of the tank, a negative pressure can start pulling the fuel out the drain and there’s nothing to stop it, except some positive air pressure.  I put my mouth in the fill hole, sealing it with my cheeks and blew.  Water shot out the drain and the flow stopped.  Luckily it was just water.  I don’t fancy doing that with a tank full of 100LL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-13/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Interior Fuel Connection&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;firewall-electronics&quot;&gt;Firewall Electronics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the firewall I mounted the battery, grounding block, and electrical pass-through.  It’s hard to know what’s the best layout for the firewall.  I’m trying to be strategic.  The electrical pass-through is right next to a engine mount arm to which I can easily run wires with zip-ties.  The negative lead of the battery is an inch or two away from the grounding block which is also right next to the engine mount arm. It’s like an electrical wire highway and parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What remains to be mounted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;master contactor/solenoid&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;voltage protection contactor/solenoid&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;voltage regulator&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;oil pressure sensor (still waiting for line and connecting hardware to arrive)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of room for all this but I’m stalling to see if any inspiration helps me find a good location for it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-13/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Firewall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been hesitating to start installing avionics and running electrical wires, but I’m running out of other things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;135-pilot-training&quot;&gt;135 Pilot Training&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started training to be a 135 charter pilot with &lt;a href=&quot;http://eliteflightjets.com/&quot;&gt;Elite Flight Jets&lt;/a&gt; today.  I continue training tomorrow so work on the OneX is taking a back seat.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Oil Separator</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Baffles</title><link href="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/09/08/baffles.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Baffles" /><published>2017-09-08T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-09-08T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/09/08/baffles</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/09/08/baffles.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;engine-baffles&quot;&gt;Engine Baffles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I never have to build engine baffles again.  ‘Nuf said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The K&amp;amp;N RC-1980 air filter seems to do the trick.  It attaches with a simple ring clamp and can be installed in such a manner so as to not interfere with the cowling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kit exhaust pipes are longer than needed.  They rest at an angle and I thought it’d look good to have them parallel with the fuselage, yet sticking out a bit to make sure the exhaust exits cleanly.  The cut line was a bit trikcy to get right, and then cutting with the grinding wheel was an experience that reminded me of the Orange County Choppers show where they fabricated choppers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-07/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Exhaust&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;firewall&quot;&gt;Firewall&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the firewall I added the ignitions, oil seperator, and battery (exact location still pending).  There’s still a few things to add but there should be plenty of room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-07/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Firewall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;baffles&quot;&gt;Baffles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hiking this morning with Angelique, I had a bit of energy the afternoon to get started on the baffles for the engine.  Sonex provided a lazer but kit, but the fit is rough there’s plenty of modifications to be made.  These baffles feel a bit hackish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a great deal of time and care to get the cowling cut nicely.  Once it fit well, I added the camlocks (from an Aeroward kit) to fasten the top cowling to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seams between the two halves were crooked (unavoidably) and I couldn’t leave it like that.  I made some micro-paste with epoxy and micro-bubbles to fill in the seams (see the first picture) and sanded them flush.  It turned out much cleaner I think.  There was also some sag in the bottom corners because I didn’t notice when I lined up the hinge rivets.  That part was probably a two man job but I did it solo.  So I reinforced the inside of the bottom corners with maybe 10 layers of fiberglass.  When dry, I sanded bottoms flush with the fuselage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-05/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Colwing Patchup&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-05/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cowling Complete&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;throttle--mixture-cables&quot;&gt;Throttle &amp;amp; Mixture Cables&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plans leave it up the builder how to run the throttle and mixture cables.  Not wanting to drill excessive holes in the longerons and support angles, I fabricated some brackets and mounted them to existing holes.  The AirWard kit came with some nice cable-safe firewall pass-throughs to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I drilled the hole for the gascolator line, I butchered that part of the firewall.  The steel is hard to drill, but very bendy.  The large drill bits catch and twist the thin steel.  So for the throttle and mixture pass-throughs, I added aluminum plates on the inside and out. This reinforcement made very clean holes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob helped me guide the cables through the bracket holes in which I had embedded rubber grommets.  This was an ordeal because the grommets kept popping out and we had to pull the cables out, re-insert the grommets, and try again.  The cables are a bit thicker where they bend and that’s where the brackets located, at the bends.  We eventually got it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-05/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cable Run&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning I connected all the cables to the controls and the AeroInjector.  The throttle was straight forward.  The mixture cable had a couple gotchas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, to cut the line to size you need to pull the inner cable out.  The mixture cable comes with the warning tag that says something like: “Do not poll knob out more then 3 inches or a ball bearning will pop out and the control will not function.”  Of course the first time I saw that I pulled it more than 3” and a tiny ball bearing did indeed pop out, and the knob no longer functioned.  I managed to find the ball bearing, get it back in and the the knob worked once again.  So today I was careful to catch the ball and no harm done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, with the mixture cable attached to the AeroInjector, the inner wire had a tendency to bend when I push the mixture full-rich or pull it (lean it), and the arm would not fully open or close.  With a washer to separate the wire from the mixture arm, and careful adjustment of the lock nut, the wire can swivel and avoid the bend.  Add to that some safety wire to hold the outer cable in place, and it resists tendency to bend even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-05/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AeroInjector Cables&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fuel-lines--burp-elimination&quot;&gt;Fuel Lines / Burp Elimination&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see in the next picture the AirWard burp elimination system.  Aluminum tube running all along the edge of the firewall, an extra flex tube running to the AeroInjector, and a “T” junction that penetrates the firewall and connects to the fuel tank vent.  The principle is that high line will allow any air bubbles to escape and since it’ll be filled with fuel, it’ll add extra pressure to the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-09-05/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Burp Elimination&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bending and flaring these aluminum tubes was a new experience.  Pipe bending, cutting, and flaring tools are fairly inexpensive.  Those adel clamps hole the lines in place nicely.  I had to cut an extra little hole in the bottom cowling for the vent tube.  When I tried the cowling on again, it was blocked by air filter (I had installed it earlier today) which was rubbing against the bottom of the cowling.  Sigh.  I trimmed the rubber tube that connects the AeroInjector to the intake manifold to no avail.  After googling the problem, other builders had resorted to alternative air filters.  So I ordered a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00062YOIG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;K&amp;amp;N RC-1980&lt;/a&gt; from Amazon.  Hopefully that works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the last two Oops fittings that go in the fuel tank.  A drain valve goes in one and the fuel level sensor will go in the other.&lt;/p&gt;
