&lt;p&gt;I complete my first charter flight as a captain, taking a couple from Las Vegas to Page AZ.  Then I did two more flights this week.  It was fun, but left less time to work on the OneX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cherrymax-rivets&quot;&gt;CherryMax Rivets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aircraftspruce.com/catalog/hapages/cherrymax4.php?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIl4OEvKbE1wIVkqDsCh03VgMLEAQYASABEgL5KvD_BwE&quot;&gt;CherryMax rivets&lt;/a&gt; arrived over the weekend. These bad boys look significantly more complex than normal rivets, and they work…. Awesome!  Maybe too awesome actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, they are the perfect size.  Yes!  They fill the oversized holes and, Dang, do they hold on tight.  The binded surfaces seem very secure, and the shafts break off flush with the head.  How cool is that?!  No holes in the center of the rivet. There were a couple new rivets that I wanted to redo, and this is where they are a bit too awesome.  I could not drill it out.  Without the hole in the factory head, I couldn’t get my drill bit to hold still.  The material seem harder as well.  It must be the cadmium. So I tried to drill it from the back, but the shaft protrudes and again I can’t get any drill action.  So, the moral here is:  Don’t mess up a CherryMax rivet.  You won’t get it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tested all the flush rivets I had previously installed.  about 90% of them fell out with little convincing from my drill.  All but a few were replaced with the CherryMax rivets.  Then I continued to rivet the outboard panel with the new flush rivets, and I ran out.  Oops.  I mis calculated how many I needed.  No problem, I can order more…. except they are not on backorder and will be for weeks.  &lt;em&gt;-sad face-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-11-16/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CherryMax Rivets&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;micro-paste&quot;&gt;Micro Paste&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the flush rivets installed, the front wing skins became a bit puckered.  Just slight warping of the skin around each rivet.  It didn’t look terrible, but the goal of the flush rivets is laminar flow.  The puckered skin won’t help, and I want to be able to show off smooth, flat wings once they’re wrapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I mixed up some micro paste, epoxy with micro balloons, that is comparable to bondo.  This I applied to a couple rivet lines, then I mixed some more micro paste, then some more. Fortunately this stuff is really light.  I’ve probably applied about 12oz, volumetrically, to smooth our rivets and seems between surfaces.  Maybe that’s like a 1/4 pound.  I’ve still got a bit more to add.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopfully, the sanding is not too laborious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-11-16/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Micro Paste&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fairings&quot;&gt;Fairings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the fairing, and mounting surfaces and been prepared with the nutplates.  From left to right we have: aileron counterweight, aileron pushrod, rudder cable,  and flap control rod.  These are just left side fairings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only flap control rod fairing solution Sonex offers is an aluminum sheet that requires some tricky bending, and even then it doesn’t look terribly good.  I decided to make one out of fliberglass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night I bring in some modeling clay to form the mold.  Tristan joins me at the table and asks for some clay to play with.  Then Angelique sits down and asks for some too.  All three us play with clay.  It was fun.  The next day I layup the glass and epoxy.  When dry, I cut it and fit it.  Works great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the tail fairing I did, with only 3 layers of glass, I used 4 layers on these flap fairings which was probabaly overkill.  They are VERY sturdy, but weight quite a bit more than the ABS fairings from sonex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tedium of preparing all the wing skin hole has been continued and completed.  &lt;em&gt;Whew&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see in the picture how the front half of the holes are dimpled.  Unfortunately, the copper clecos kept popping out of these dimpled holes.  This was the clue #1 of the mistake I made.  More later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the skins all prepped and clecoed back in place on the wings it was time to rivet.  But wait… I should make sure the control surfaces fit, right?  And their push rods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-11-09/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dimpled Holes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ailerons-and-flaps&quot;&gt;Ailerons and Flaps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had received the replacement flap skin (remember, I ruined that last one) so I assembled the right flap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I tried on the ailerons, they fit but motion was seriously limited.  The bolts that hold the counterweight were too long to fit through the cutout in the wing skin.  Rather than make the cutout bigger I decided to make the counterweight assembly smaller.  Replacing the normal nuts with thin special nuts I had left over, along with using a light washer instead of the regular, and cutting the tip of the bolt off removed about an inch from the width of the counterweight; small enough to fit right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was also a good time to address the lack of counterweight mass.  The top of the counterweight hits the top skin flush, and width was already a problem, so the bottom of the counter weight is where I could beef it up.  Check out the balancing rig below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cut some 5mm slices of lead to match the full width of the counterweight assembly.  This allowed for the thinnest profile possible with sufficient weight.  I drilled two holes vertically through the middle to attach with flush screws and a countersunk hole on the top so the nut would not add any height.  The screws had to be trimmed as well.  Then I shaved some lead off until it looked balanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-11-09/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Balanced Aileron&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the control rod pass-throughs had to be filed, but otherwise everything fits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rivetting&quot;&gt;Rivetting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are basically 3 difference rivets used on the wing skins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CCP-42 are short, round head blind (Cherry) rivets used on the ribs, hinge, and rear spar with is thin like the ribs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CCP-44 are a bit longer, still round head blind (Cherry) rivets used where the skin meets the main spar, which is thicker.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CCC-42 are short, countersunk head blind (Cherry) rivets for the dimpled holes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on the underside on the left inner panel, I started with the CCP-42 rivets and they went in great.  Then I moved on to spar using the CCP-44 rivets… you get a nice “thunk” reverberation sound when you rivet into the spar.  This lets you know you’ve got a solid hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riveting the dimpled holes was a bit more problematic.  Clue #2: The mandrels of the rivets were protruding out more often the usual after being pulled.  This is sign that maybe the shaft didn’t grab as deep as it should have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clue #3: A couple rivets were loose. Then I tried pushing from the inside and some just popped right out of the hole!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok… so the rivets aren’t holding in the dimpled holes.  I anticipated this problem because as I dimpled the holes I could see them expand.  So what now?  As I search for a solution I noticed something in the plans.  Off on the side, in the notes a sub-figure, there is it:  “Use a #31 or #32 drill bit, not a #30.”  Doh!  I already used #30 on ALL the dimpled holes.  Again… what now?  Obviously I can’t continue with rivets that fall out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I could create a ribbon of aluminum sheet, line the inside of the ribs, used smaller countersunk rivets to hold it into place and then drill #30 holes that the rivets will grab on to.  But, jeez, that’s a heavy and clunky solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out there’s some rivets out there called Cherry Max rivets that are made in an oversized dimension, just a bit wider than #30 drill bits.  It also looks like they have the same size head as normal Cherry rivets.  They cost about 6x what normal Cherry rivets cost, but I think it’s a more elegant solution.  I ordered some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, might as well rivet the rest of the holes.  So I did.  That is, all except the top of the inboard skins.  These will get rivets last, once I’m done with the pitot, AOA, OAT plumbing.  I also left the aileron hinges unriveted so they could be removed when the controls get rigged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-11-09/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wings&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Wing Rivet Hole Prep</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Tips and Dimples</title><link href="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/11/06/tips-and-dimples.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tips and Dimples" /><published>2017-11-06T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-11-06T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/11/06/tips-and-dimples</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/11/06/tips-and-dimples.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;wing-tips&quot;&gt;Wing Tips&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fiberglass wing tips are over-sized, as usual.  I ended up cutting 8” off the end to get maximum clearance through my garage door.  A metal strip is added to the inside of the fiberglass to add strength.  Still, there’s no significant structure holding the tips on… maybe 3/4” overlap with the wing skins… just enough for a line of rivets all the way around.  I can’t help but think that if the tips were much longer, they’d produce enough lift to rip themselves off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-11-06/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wing Tips&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tiedowns&quot;&gt;Tiedowns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fat nut plate just inside the bottom of the wing skin.  It’s from the AirWard tie down kit.  When desired, I can screw in an eye-bolt as a tie-down point.  You can see it is securely fastened to the spar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-11-06/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tie Down&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pitotaoa&quot;&gt;Pitot/AOA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally settled on a location for the pitot/AOA tube.  Some modification of the Dynon install kit was required, but I feel like I have a much stronger mount then they prescribe.  It’s located just behind the main spar.  It’d be all the way at the end of the inboard wing but there’s an inspection hole there so it’s about 8” inboard from the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TODO: include picture of pitot mount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;oat&quot;&gt;OAT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also placed the Outside Air Temperature sensor on the right wing just behind the pitot tube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;skin-hole-prep&quot;&gt;Skin Hole Prep&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rivet prep has begun.  Starting with the right inboard skin, I deburred, scrubbed with scotch brite, deburred spars and ribs,  dimpled the front skin holes, dimpled the front ribs, and clecoed it back in place.  This took almost 4 hours. I started the left side in the afternoon but didn’t finish because my rivet puller broke while using Sonex’s Super Simple Dimple Die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only four more skins to go.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Wing Tips</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Wing Skins</title><link href="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/11/02/wing-skins.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Wing Skins" /><published>2017-11-02T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-11-02T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/11/02/wing-skins</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/11/02/wing-skins.html">&lt;p&gt;Skins are all drilled.

&lt;p&gt;Got the ailerons finished… mostly.  In order to properly balance them, they should be painted first, or wrapped in my case.  (side note: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/RenbFgLZBNA&quot;&gt;Fascinating video showing why ailerons must have a counterweight&lt;/a&gt;)  So I get to try out the vinyl wrap!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My design calls for grey on the bottom and green on the top.  Here’s one wrapped and the other unwrapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-10-30/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before and After&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right wing has a stripe that crosses the aileron.  The knifeless cutting tape works great!  Nice flush cuts between material.  One issue I have is the the top/bottom transition occurs right at the tail end of the aileron which is a pretty sharp curve.  The vinyl doesn’t like ending on a such a corner so I had to order some sealing tape.  I have liquid sealant for vinyl but reports say that it leaves a nail polish-like finish that doesn’t look so nice.  We’ll see how the tape works first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-10-30/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Right Aileron&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frustatingly, the counter weight isn’t heavy enough… even with the naked ailerons.  Grrrrr… I cut the lead ingot exactly the size the plans called for!  Now I’ll have to get the wings finished and figure out how I can add more weight to the aileron counterweights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wing-skins&quot;&gt;Wing Skins&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wing skins are time consuming.  Lots and lots of holes.  The skins need to be filed to fit properly.  Much work remains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-10-30/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wingos Skins&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Ailerons</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Wing Work</title><link href="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/10/25/wing-work.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Wing Work" /><published>2017-10-25T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-10-25T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/10/25/wing-work</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/10/25/wing-work.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;wings-attached&quot;&gt;Wings Attached&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attaching the wings required some special tools; reamers.  These are like drill bits that make very precise sized holes.  I had ordered them from Amazon but one was the wrong size.  Fortunately Denny Myrick had them from his build and let me borrow it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-10-25/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wing's Attached&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are basically two bolts that hold the wing on.  A fat AN6 bolt on which the wings pivot on the upper spar, and a similarly fat pin that slides in a hole on the bottom.  The pin is attached to a lever to lock and release the wing.  The lever also controls a long pin that locks the rear spar in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-10-25/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wing Fold&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wing-locks&quot;&gt;Wing Locks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were a purchase from AirWard.  They required a bit of modification but perform a sturdy job of holding the wings up.  They cleverly make use of the holes and pins of the locking system&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-10-25/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wing Locks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;flaps&quot;&gt;Flaps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before putting on the wing skins, I decided to install as much flaps and aileron controls as possible before they become entombed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I clumsily cut one of the flaps upside down and ruined the part.  Doh!  Another is on order from Sonex.  The left flap is complete and feels pretty solid.  The flaps will attach to the inboard wing sections and are a little over 2’ long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-10-25/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flap&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ailerons&quot;&gt;Ailerons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ailerons go along the complete outboard section and are nearly 6’ long!  Being so long, they require significantly more work…. lot of holes to drill, debur, etc…  They’re still under construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of note, they include a counterweight.  For this Sonex provided a ~20lb solid ingot of lead that needed to be cut.   You can see the smaller ingots bolted to the arms below. For months I feared the wear and destruction this ingot of lead would put on my tools.  Alas, lead is like butter when it comes to sawing and drilling.  Fascinating!  It’s massive rock-like appearance betrays it’s gentle workability.  In fairness, I’d assumed it was steel until I learned it was lead today.  Oh, lead does like to cease up on drill bits.  Using lots of oil is the lesson of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have roughly 10lbs of smaller lead ingots left over.  I wonder what those could be used for.&lt;/p&gt;

Upon getting back I continued work on the wing-fold parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aileron-control-bells&quot;&gt;Aileron Control Bells&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see in the first picture how these swivel paddles (not sure real name) mount to plates at the end of the spars.  This half goes on the outboard spar (the part that folds up) and will be connected to the ailerons.  The inboard paddles will connect to the control stick and translate control inputs to the ailerons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had both halves done, I lined them up and noticed that the paddles didn’t line up well at all.  The ball bearings rested on the very edge of the opposing paddles.  I doubled checked the plans several times, but I had followed them correctly.  Eventually I decided the plans were wrong and I was able to solve the problem by drilling out some rivets and putting the outboard paddles on the top of the swivel bell instead of the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-10-19/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wing Fold Fix&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wing-fold-panels&quot;&gt;Wing Fold Panels&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the wing-halves meet, there are these plates that have soooo many rivets.  As I drilled, deburred and counter sunk all those holes, I had plenty of time to wonder why so many rivets would be needed.  You can see in the picture above that there’s not much structure to hold together; just two sheets. The best answer I could think of was: Why not?  The rivets do add strength to the layers and don’t add much weight.  But maybe it’s overkill.  Those extra rivers sure added a lot of labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-10-19/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wing Fold Installed&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before attaching the outboard spars, the plans have you install the ribs, skin, and fiberglass tips.  I was going to get the folding joint secured first to save workshop room, but the rear spar participates in the fold-locking mechanism so I have at least have to get the ribs attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I clecoed them all together I noticed that the inner most forward rib was about 1/8” shorter than the others.  There are spacers on almost all the ribs to make them equal length, but somehow the plans didn’t get it right… and no spacer was provided for this rib.  So again I went off script and made my own spacer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These assemblies are all riveted and bolted now.  Tomorrow I’ll see if I can get the spars attached and folding.&lt;/p&gt;

All the squawks have been addressed and were not necessarily what I suspected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rpms&quot;&gt;RPMs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swapping the RPM sensor lead to the other side of the Voltage regulator did the trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alternator-output&quot;&gt;Alternator Output&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wired up some extentions to the alternator and voltage regulator leads so I could measure with a voltmeter while I sat in the cockpit.  All signals are good.  Alternator is generating high voltage and the regulator is regulating.  I found that output is not great at the low RPMs at which I was initially running the engine.  When I got above 2,000 RPM, the alternator output was much more reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ignition&quot;&gt;Ignition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ignition timing needed adjusting.  Once I centered it, the engine ran MUCH smoother.  Currently I get about a 60-70 RPM drop when I turn off the magnetos and/or ignition.  Fine tuning is needed, but I may need to get in the air to figure out whether I need to retard or advance the timing.  Or maybe my mechanic will be able to tell on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;unsteady-rpms&quot;&gt;Unsteady RPMs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, I found, was a result of vibrations moving the throttle.  Tightening the friction solved the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;oil-leaks&quot;&gt;Oil Leaks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding the exact source of the leaks was not easy.  I tightened and resealed many parts before I found the actual source.  No more oil seeps out of the engine now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wing-ribs&quot;&gt;Wing Ribs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work on the wings resumes.  I attached the inboard wing ribs to the spar.  Am working on the wing fold ribs which are quite involved.  I had started these months ago but put them on hold.  Now I have a much clearer idea of how they fit in.&lt;/p&gt;

Below there’s a video of the event recorded by my son Luka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preparation&quot;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding fuel 1/2 gallons at a time, I marked the fuel level on the tank up to 3 gallons.  Sitting in the plane, I can only see up to 2 gallons but it could be useful in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AeroVee manual says to prime the oil first.  This involved removing 4 spark plugs, 1 from each cylinder, and making sure the oil pressure sensor reads an increase in pressure when running the starter.  Mine read 57 PSI before I touched the starter, and it never budged.  That’s not right!  Dynon support says it’s likely a faulty pressure sensor (Kavlico 150 PSI).  Apparently they’ve had a few similar reports with these sensors so they’re sending me a new one.  I had a spare “legacy” mechanical sensor so I connected that one and it worked.  No show stopper here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pulled the plane out to the basketball court again, chained it to the post, put the parking breaks on, and put chocks under the tires.  Who know what could happen and you can’t be too safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-10-05/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Test Location&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;first-engine-test&quot;&gt;First Engine Test&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luka came out to assist.  His job was to check for leaking fluids and film the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first try, the engine popped a few times.  Perhaps I was too gentle on the throttle, or perhaps the engine needed a few moments to stretch a bit before coming to life for the first time.  But it didn’t take long to get it running steady… and boy did it get windy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/237020116&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazing!  I’d never built an engine before.  It’s fascinating that a newb like me can put all those engine pieces together and get a working engine that starts on the first test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;squawks&quot;&gt;Squawks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll see in the video that once the engine is running, I’m checking all the sensors and performance.  Most everything worked great but there are a few problems I need to investigate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The RPM indicator showed 0 when I turned the alternator on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The battery didn’t charge and eventually died.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Although the magnetos worked great, the ignitions were intermittent.  When I turned the mags off, the engine would sputter and threaten to quit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The RPMs were a bit unsteady, tending to rise and fall without any change in throttle, except at idle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A small amount of oil leaked out from the oil cooler mount, drain bolt, and oil pump.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the plane back in the garage, I tightened some bolt to seal the oil leaks.  And with some quick research, I discovered that I may have connected the RPM sensor lead to the wrong terminal on the voltage regulator.  This may be the cause for most the other problems. I swapped the leads and we’ll see how that helps tomorrow.  When I reposition the AeroInjector, that may help with the sporadic RPMs.  I’ll report in a later blog.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Fired up the engine for the first time today.

Most experimental aircraft accidents occur in the first few hours of flight due to fuel flow problems.  So it’s important to test it.  Here’s how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Convention says that an engine needs 0.55 lbs of fuel per hour for each HP, at maximum power.  My AeroVee is 80HP, so that’s 44lbs per hours.  Each gallon of 100LL weights 6 pounds so that 7.33 gallons / hr, and we measure the flow at the point where the fuel enters the carburetor, or AeroInjector in my case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the OneX has a gravity fed fuel system (no pump), the FAA mandates a safety factor of 150%. I should see 11 gal/hr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this fuel demand is typically on take off where the engine is high.  It’s best to perform the test at 5° above the maximum climb attitude.  I couldn’t find any documentation for OneX climb angles, but if you consider short field take offs where the highest climb rate is required, common procedure is an initial climb rate of 10° until you clear any obstacle, and then you shallow the climb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, I should see a 11 gallons per hour flowing out at the AeroInjector with the aircraft at a 15° nose-up attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does one get an unfinished plane into a 15° nose up attitude?  At rest it sits at 6° because I have a tail dragger. On Sunday I built a ramp/platform for the main gears.  I needed help so it was fortunate that Luka has some friends over for homework.  Together we were able to push it up there.  That got us 12°, but it was a bit precarious and I wasn’t comfortable putting any more bricks.  I rant the test anyway and measured 6.6 gal/hr.  Out of the gascolator I got 12.9 gal/hr but that doesn’t really count, so it didn’t pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized later that I had the gas tank sealed and the vent doesn’t open unless there’s airflow.  Perhaps there was a negative pressure building in the tank.  My mechanic, Tony, also told me I need to put more than 1 gallons in the tank… at least two or three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-10-04/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Plane On Ramp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little trigonometry says I need to raise the main gears about 2’ to get 15°.  Rather than raise the main gear more, I figured I could dig a hole and lower the tail into it.  Digging a hole in Arizona is way harder than diging a hole in Illinois by the way.  But I got one about a foot and a half deep.  Then I pushed the plane up a little ramp and this yielded 15.6°.  I was hoping for 20° but this was good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-10-04/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Plane in Hole&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuring the flow again, with the tank open and 3 gallons in the tank, I measured 6.25 gal / hr.  Oh no!  There’s something seriously wrong!  After pondering the problem for a long while, I realized that the fuel had to flow up hill from the gascolator to get to the injector.  The injector was angled way up due to the silicone hose and it’s angle could easily be adjusted with different hose.  So I repositioned the fuel line to a point at which I could lower the injector input and measured 11.5 gal/hr. Whew! That made all the difference.  I took a few more measurements, let the tank drain, and measured the “unusable fuel” remaining in the tank, about 1/8 of a gallon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ordered some new hoses to explore a few options.  The trick is getting the air filter to attach to the AeroInjector without interfering with the lower cowling.  But now I know where the fuel intake has to be to get the flow required.&lt;/p&gt;
