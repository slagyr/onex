&lt;p&gt;Got the windshield fastened today.  Lots of details were involved.  One problem I had was that the holes on the fuselage needed to be dimpled, but the holes were too big for the two dimple dies included.  But I figured out how to make one.  In the second picture you can see that my once soft computer programmer hands have been beat up and turned into tough mechanic hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-05-24/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Finished Windshield&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-05-24/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dimple Die&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;seat-belts&quot;&gt;Seat belts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bolts for the seat belts (that weren’t included in the hardware kit &lt;em&gt;grrr&lt;/em&gt;) arrived today.  I had previously prepared the attach points so I bolted them on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-05-24/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Seat Belts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting on the canopy, I counted all the parts the plans call for that weren’t in the kit.  There are four.  Four parts that should have been in the kit.  So I emailed Kerry.  In the mean time I considered the canopy bows.  These are aluminum tubes that frame the inside of the canopy.   They come in rough curves but need to be shaped precisely and cut to length.  But how do you bend an aluminum tube to shape?  Well &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oy-raf.dk/&quot;&gt;Bjarne Jensen&lt;/a&gt; hit me up over email and suggested I look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://onex-svingenb.blogspot.dk/&quot;&gt;Bjoernar Swingen’s blog&lt;/a&gt;. I noticed he used play work templates. I thought I’d give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-05-24/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Canopy Bow Template&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I made the template, I realized that I’m gonne need something stronger than my hands to bend it.  So I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onexmike.org/canopy.html&quot;&gt;this post by good old OneX Mike&lt;/a&gt;.  I’ll give it a try tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Windshield</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Windshield</title><link href="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/05/23/windshield.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Windshield" /><published>2017-05-23T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-05-23T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/05/23/windshield</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://micahmartin.com/onex/2017/05/23/windshield.html">&lt;p&gt;Don’t be decieved.  In the image below, the windshield and canopy are merely resting on top of the fuselage.  They are not fastened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the two, the windshield is supposed to be attached first.  Despite not fully understanding the plans, I proceeded like you would with a math problem; start with the knowns.  In this case, it’s the windshield strap.  I could see where it is attached and that it rests at a 60° relative to the longerons.  That I could do, so I did.  Then I put the windshield back on.  Ahhh… I could see it all now.  The windshield, an oversized sheet of glassy plastic with protective vinyl on both sides, overlapped the strap and it was obvious where to cut it.  And clearly it was too wide so I shaved a 1/4” off both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used my oscillating tool to make the cuts and it worked awesome.  Balancing it on my band saw was a scary thought and the hand held oscillating tool allowed me to cut it precisely while it rested on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the first cuts, it wouldn’t rest flush against the firewall in the front, no matter how I pushed it.  It was not obvious why.  I trimed some of the front corners but that didn’t help.  Then I tried removing the firewall/windshield strap.  That did it.  The clecoes where blocking it.  So I cut about 1/2” off the front and it fit wonderfully.  So I began drilling all the holes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airward.com/&quot;&gt;AirWard&lt;/a&gt; kit had instructions and hardware to use here so that the windshield is easily removable.  However, I got the gist of it and decided to go a bit off script.  With the big picture grasped, I know how to best craft it to my taste.  I should have it attached tomorrow, except for the fuel fill hole and cover… there’s supposed to be a 4.5” hole right in the middle of the windhield with an ugly aluminum plate covering it.  The plans don’t even say how to attach the aluminum plate.  I checked &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airward.com/amelia/search.asp?advnav=&amp;amp;action=Search&amp;amp;store=&amp;amp;cat=10000781&amp;amp;subcat_10000013=10000781&amp;amp;ShowImages=&amp;amp;ShowDetails=&amp;amp;menuID=873~873&amp;amp;id=889&quot;&gt;AirWard and was pleased to see they have a solution for this&lt;/a&gt; that includes a transparent cover with easy access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;spar-ends&quot;&gt;Spar Ends&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much to show here but I received the needed bolts and washers to finish assembling the spar tips and tighten all the bolts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;glare-shield&quot;&gt;Glare Shield&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been where most of the effort has gone in the past few days.  The glare shield is a sheet of metal that goes in front of the pilot and just under the wind shield.  It attaches to the upper firewall and the instrument panel in addition to the longerons.  The plans would have you rivet it all into place, never to be removed unless you want to drill out all the rivets.  Fortunately fellow OneX builder Denny Marick told me about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airward.com/amelia/search.asp?advnav=&amp;amp;action=Search&amp;amp;store=&amp;amp;cat=10000759&amp;amp;subcat_10000013=10000759&amp;amp;ShowImages=&amp;amp;ShowDetails=&amp;amp;menuID=873~873&amp;amp;id=892&quot;&gt;Air Ward kit to make this glare shield removable&lt;/a&gt;.  It mostly involves installing nut plate where rivets would go.  Each nut plate requires 2 extra holes where rivets will hold the nut plate on. It adds a good deal more work, but it’s worth it in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-05-22/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Glare Shield Clecoed&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-05-22/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Glare Shield Screwed&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fuel-tank&quot;&gt;Fuel Tank&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tank sits just below the glare shield, so it made sense to get that installed now.  It’s held up by two straps attached to the longerons, right where the glare shield attaches.  There was a problem here.  The fuel tank was bloated and wouldn’t fit in place. This is probably due to the change in temperature between freezing Oshkosh WI, from where it was shipped in January, to the 105° weather in Phoenix where I’m installing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a trick that my dad used to use to crush milk jugs.  He’d put a bit of water into the empty gallon milk container and stick it in the microwave oven until the water was boiling.  Then he’s put the cap on and run it under cold water.  The milk container would shrink to a fraction of the size, taking less space in the trash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I boiled some water and poured it in the tank.  To get a little extra help I made sure to pour over the problem area hoping the heat would soften the plastic.  I put the cap on and the tank began to bloat more!  While pressing in on the problem area I ran the outdoor faucet over the tank and presto, magico, the tank contracted; not as much as the milk jug, just a bit.  Once cooled, I opened the cap and although the tank expanded a bit, the problem area was fixed and the tank fit perfectly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is the windshield and canopy.  Today I fabricated and prepared most of the parts.  And I studied the plans, lots.  This is not and obvious assembly.  What makes it more challenging is that it’s ALL curves.  I’m going to see if I can find videos or blogs of other people who’ve done this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wrap&quot;&gt;Wrap&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a test for going the vinyl wrap route as apposed to paint, I decided to wrap the hood of my car to get a feel for the process.  I got Luka to help me.  There was a learning curve.  It actually took us three attempts over 2 weeks and we ruined two wraps.  I had to order a new one with each failed attempt.  But in the end we got it as you can see in the first pic.  The carbon fiber texture and anthracite color is subtle, which is how I wanted it.&lt;br /&gt;
Lesson learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t stress about bubbles.  The 3M vinyl actually breathes allowing you to push bubbles out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Peel off the backing while the wrap is upside down.  With your partner, flip it, gently stretch it and lay it down to cover the surface.  Getting the general layout right and smooth on the first try goes a long way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t over work the vinyl.  I found that it weakens as you work it.  Eventually it rips.  That’s bad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use a heat gun to restore the vinyls shape and integrity.  It’s cool material.  It remembers it’s shape.  So when it get’s stretched, maybe by your fingers, heat it and it will morph back into it’s original shape.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watch lots of youtube videos.  There’s tons of techniques to learn from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;spar-ends&quot;&gt;Spar Ends&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ends of the spars have several parts that get bolted on.  See second picture.  Of course hardware is missing from the kit so I had to order more from Aircraft Spruce.  Unbelievably I ran our of washers. The kit came with 20, FAR too few.  I ordered 150 more a few weeks ago.  But that still wasn’t enough so I ordered 400 more.  For now, most of the bolts are in place.   I’ll have to revisit this to put washers in place and swap out some bolts for the correct ones that are on order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/onex/img/2017-05-17/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spar Ends&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-seat&quot;&gt;A Seat&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was fun.  Once the seat was installed I couldn’t help but to jump in and try it out.  I just chilled for a few minutes in the half finished cockpit.  Although it looks tiny from the outside, it feels rather spacious on the inside.  Luka and Tristan tried it out too when they got back from school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;flap-retainer&quot;&gt;Flap Retainer&lt;/h4&gt;

I can honestly say that I prefer the pull rivets over the solid rivets any day.  Why?  Bucking rivets is strenuous.  I began on Friday and it started fun.  But after a few dozen, my elbow was sore from holding the bucking bar, and I had a blister on hand from the hammer.  The hammer is a nice pneumatic gun, but all those impacts that their toll.  I had to quit after a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday I recruited Luka and his friend Caleb to help me by holding the bucking bar.  After a few botched rivets, we got the hang of working together but time was tight and we only got about 100 rivets bucked before time ran out.  There are over 300 in the main spar. So I continued today and toughed it out until they were all done.  Whew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason the rivets that went through the angles, at the top and bottom, took much much longer to buck.  Maybe 5 time more blows with the hammer.  Where the angle tappered out, they got easy again.  Not sure why.  There must be something about the angles that absorbs the impacts, leaving less energy to squeeze the rivets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once complete, I managed to slide the spar into place.  This was no easy task either.  It required filing edges and some brute force with a rubber mallet to get it into place.  I was careful not to damage anything and in the end it fit nicely.  The brackets that attach the spar to the fuselage are in the works.&lt;/p&gt;

This morning I fabricated about 8 more parts.  Then the main spar webs.  These are 2 long, heavy pieces of aluminum that provide the main structure of the main spar.  They came prefabricated to the right shape with pilot holes, but the pilot holes are tiny, not even a pin hole.  But thank goodness they are there.  It would take a very long time to measure those 100’s of locations.  And without a pilot hole, there’s always minor errors in where the drill actually penetrates the metal and they can add up.  With the pilot hole, small though it may be, the drill bit tends to seek it out and follow it through making precisely located holes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took hours to drill all those holes.  Note there are two layers in the picture, the bottom layer as more holes than the top.   I got a work out wrestling those parts to hold still in the right place on the drill press, 100’s of times. Then it took hours to debur.  I also filed the edges to remove stress risers.  Tedious work.  Now they are ready to mate with the the other spar parts and I’ll get to up-drill all the holes and debur them again!&lt;/p&gt;

This morning I fabricated about 8 more parts.  Then the main spar webs.  These are 2 long, heavy pieces of aluminum that provide the main structure of the main spar.  They came prefabricated to the right shape with pilot holes, but the pilot holes are tiny, not even a pin hole.  But thank goodness they are there.  It would take a very long time to measure those 100’s of locations.  And without a pilot hole, there’s always minor errors in where the drill actually penetrates the metal and they can add up.  With the pilot hole, small though it may be, the drill bit tends to seek it out and follow it through making precisely located holes.

It took hours to drill all those holes.  Note there are two layers in the picture, the bottom layer as more holes than the top.

The fiberglass mold I laid out yesterday came off the plane very nicely.  The plane is not glued together in terrible ways… whew!  But boy was it a mess.  Wax, silicon film, clay, and epoxy all over the place.  These are not the type of products where a dry paper towel simply soaks up the mess.  I has to use a putty knife, mineral spirits, alcohol, scotch-brite, and dozens of paper towels. To make matters worse, I found dried epoxy finger prints on portions of the plane I didn’t protect with mold release agents (2nd pic).  I was wearing gloves and must not have noticed that I spilled some epoxy on my fingers.  It took a good portion of elbow grease to get those out.  The good news is that epoxy sticks to aluminum very well which means I can use some micro putty to create smaller permanent fairings on other joints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was all worth it.  After lots cutting the fairing piece and lots of sanding, it’s done.  See the first picture.  I love this solution far more than kit solution. Let me count the ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 piece instead of two&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8 screws instead of 20&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I installed a nut plate for each screw wherease the kit used sheet metal screws that thread into the sheet metal!?  They even warn you in the plans not to over tighten the screws less they strip.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All 3 joints have a fairing to improve aerodynamics.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;About 40 rivets are covered up, reducing drag.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Better lines and no gaps between parts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons? Well, a polished aluminum finish here won’t work… not that this matters for me, and there are already a bunch of fiberglass parts (like wing tips).  The weight is about the same as the aluminum covers.  My biggest concern is that it’s untested.  I think it’ll work great but I’m not sure how it’ll hold up to 150 knot winds.  Worst case scenario is that the wind rips it off and the plane will experience more drag.  Not a deal breaker.  I’m considering adding more glass to reinforce the part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued work on the wing bellcrank mounts that I started yesterday, but the plans are ambiguous.  It’s unclear exactly how some peices are supposed to be assembled.  Measurements are missing.  So rather then drill holes and pull rivets in the wrong place, I’m putting this task on hold until I know exactly how the parts are supposed to fit with the rest of the wing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings me to the main spar.  The last picture shows the majority of material required.  I still have a few beams to cut.  This is going to be a hefty meld of metal.&lt;/p&gt;

See the first picture.  They required lots of bending to make them fit. It was non-trivial and I think I did a poor job.  This became an opportunity to try out some composite technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First was the play-dough, err modelling clay.  You can see a rough fill of the corners.  I left the panels in to give a shape to work around but they’ll go when it’s done.  Then I smoothed out the clay and removed the excess.  I’ve never sculpted much so this took a couple hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I was using the body of the plane as a mold, I had to take precautions to make sure the epoxy doesn’t stick to the plane.  This fairing will be removable so there’s access to the tail section.  I feared the epoxy would go everywhere and glue the plane in terrible ways.  So I took double precautions.  Mirror Wax, and Silicon spray. Both are mold release agents.  I really hope they do the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cut the fiberglass and peel pry.  Weighed it, and started mixing the epoxy.  Layer by layer I laid out the material and wetted it.  The glass is quite capable of handing the curves but the peel pry, not so much.  If I had to do it again, I’d cut small pieces to better fit the mold.  This was using one piece per layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While that sets, I bolted the engine mount and fabricated some parts for the wing fold assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
