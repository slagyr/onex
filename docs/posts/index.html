        So OnexMike’s technique didn’t work for me. I lined up the bow with the template and pounded it with the rubber hammer and nothing happened except a lot of bouncing. I’m not sure how he got it to work. No problem. I had a plan “B” which was to make...

        Windshield Got the windshield fastened today. Lots of details were involved. One problem I had was that the holes on the fuselage needed to be dimpled, but the holes were too big for the two dimple dies included. But I figured out how to make one. In the second picture...

        Don’t be decieved. In the image below, the windshield and canopy are merely resting on top of the fuselage. They are not fastened. Of the two, the windshield is supposed to be attached first. Despite not fully understanding the plans, I proceeded like you would with a math problem; start...

        Since my last blog, I’ve begun a few separate tasks but missing hardware has delayed each until today. Spar Ends Not much to show here but I received the needed bolts and washers to finish assembling the spar tips and tighten all the bolts. Glare Shield This has been where...
