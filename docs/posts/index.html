        Avionics Research Denny was kind enough to let me visit his build again and ask questions about avionics. After doing research at Oshkosh and on the web, I’ve decided to go with Dynon Avionics in a very similar configuration to Denny. But there are hundreds of questions I had about...

        As Hannah and Rob (family friends) walked by the garage last week as I was fabricating brake parts, we chatted and I mentioned that I didn’t know exactly how to install hydraulic brakes. It turns out that Hannah’s dad (Vic) was coming to town. He’s handy with cars and knows...

        Controls Parts Continuing with the controls, I started with the flaps. Missing hardware prevented me from fastening the control stick to the mounting rod. So I moved on to the aileron/stabilizer control and got the stick attached. Then on to some pulleys, mounting brackets, and most everything required to put...

        Summer was awesome but it’s time to get back to work. Oshkosh 2017 Luka and I flew up to Oshkosh on Sunday and camped next to the airplane. What a great time. We saw plenty of aircraft, of course. For the first time I was able to attend lots of...

        Yesterday I finished the canopy. See below. It’s… okay. I’m not thrilled with how it turned out, but it’s good enough that I don’t feel the need to redo it. My main gripe is that there’s two spots where it bows up, not fitting flush with the edges. On the...
