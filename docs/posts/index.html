        Yesterday… I tried to decipher the plans and figure out how all the inboard spar pieces fit together. In my head I had expected the spar to be just one or two long pieces of beefy metal. Not so. There’s got to be thirty pieces or so. Once assembled they...

        Friday was a busy day and I only got to work 4 hours fabricating parts for the main spar. This morning I fabricated about 8 more parts. Then the main spar webs. These are 2 long, heavy pieces of aluminum that provide the main structure of the main spar. They...

        Three hours after beginning work I had everything cleaned up. The fiberglass mold I laid out yesterday came off the plane very nicely. The plane is not glued together in terrible ways… whew! But boy was it a mess. Wax, silicon film, clay, and epoxy all over the place. These...

        I’m not at all pleased with the way the tail panels came out. See the first picture. They required lots of bending to make them fit. It was non-trivial and I think I did a poor job. This became an opportunity to try out some composite technique. First was the...

        File! Grind! File! That’s how the day began. The horizontal tail and the rudder need to travel 25° up and down, left and right respectively. Not only that, their lever arms need to hit squarely with the surfaces they meet at the end of their travel. To achieve this meant...
