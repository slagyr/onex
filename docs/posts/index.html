        I drilled. I deburred. I got a repetitive stress injury. At least I suspect I am. It’s the deburring. It puts a lot of pressure on the center of my palm and I think it’s the cause of a loss of sensitivity in my fingers in the last couple of...

        Yesterday… I tried to decipher the plans and figure out how all the inboard spar pieces fit together. In my head I had expected the spar to be just one or two long pieces of beefy metal. Not so. There’s got to be thirty pieces or so. Once assembled they...

        Friday was a busy day and I only got to work 4 hours fabricating parts for the main spar. This morning I fabricated about 8 more parts. Then the main spar webs. These are 2 long, heavy pieces of aluminum that provide the main structure of the main spar. They...

        </h2>
        Three hours after beginning work I had everything cleaned up. The fiberglass mold I laid out yesterday came off the plane very nicely. The plane is not glued together in terrible ways… whew! But boy was it a mess. Wax, silicon film, clay, and epoxy all over the place. These...

        </h2>
        I’m not at all pleased with the way the tail panels came out. See the first picture. They required lots of bending to make them fit. It was non-trivial and I think I did a poor job. This became an opportunity to try out some composite technique. First was the...
