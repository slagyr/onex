        </h2>
        Skins are all drilled. The tricky part here was getting the ribs lined up and centered on the holes that needed drilling. In many cases it was impossible to reach around the skins to adjust the rib positions. That’s especially true when on my back under the wing. Angelique was...

        Ailerons Got the ailerons finished… mostly. In order to properly balance them, they should be painted first, or wrapped in my case. (side note: Fascinating video showing why ailerons must have a counterweight) So I get to try out the vinyl wrap! My design calls for grey on the bottom...

        </h2>
        Wings Attached Attaching the wings required some special tools; reamers. These are like drill bits that make very precise sized holes. I had ordered them from Amazon but one was the wrong size. Fortunately Denny Myrick had them from his build and let me borrow it. There are basically two...

        Last week was fall break and I had a great time with the family in Disney Land and Lego Land in California. Upon getting back I continued work on the wing-fold parts. Aileron Control Bells You can see in the first picture how these swivel paddles (not sure real name)...

        The engine is pretty well tuned at this point. All the squawks have been addressed and were not necessarily what I suspected. RPMs Swapping the RPM sensor lead to the other side of the Voltage regulator did the trick. Alternator Output I wired up some extentions to the alternator and...
