        Three hours after beginning work I had everything cleaned up. The fiberglass mold I laid out yesterday came off the plane very nicely. The plane is not glued together in terrible ways… whew! But boy was it a mess. Wax, silicon film, clay, and epoxy all over the place. These...

        I’m not at all pleased with the way the tail panels came out. See the first picture. They required lots of bending to make them fit. It was non-trivial and I think I did a poor job. This became an opportunity to try out some composite technique. First was the...

        File! Grind! File! That’s how the day began. The horizontal tail and the rudder need to travel 25° up and down, left and right respectively. Not only that, their lever arms need to hit squarely with the surfaces they meet at the end of their travel. To achieve this meant...

        The tail is attached! It all began last Friday. Christoph, a colleague from 8th Light in London was in town for a conference. After we flew to Sedona for lunch I convinced him to help me attach the tail surfaces to the fuselage. We tried out the vertical tail and...

        Three trips to the hardware store today. The first was to Ace to get a thread tap to make a threaded hole in the bellcrannk faces. Those are done. They’re for translating control inputs from the inside part of the wing to the outside, and they’re pretty nifty. Remeber the...
