        Since my last blog, I’ve begun a few separate tasks but missing hardware has delayed each until today. Spar Ends Not much to show here but I received the needed bolts and washers to finish assembling the spar tips and tighten all the bolts. Glare Shield This has been where...

        Lots to report: Wrap As a test for going the vinyl wrap route as apposed to paint, I decided to wrap the hood of my car to get a feel for the process. I got Luka to help me. There was a learning curve. It actually took us three attempts...

        </h2>
        All the solid rivets in the main spar have been bucked. I can honestly say that I prefer the pull rivets over the solid rivets any day. Why? Bucking rivets is strenuous. I began on Friday and it started fun. But after a few dozen, my elbow was sore from...

        I drilled. I deburred. I got a repetitive stress injury. At least I suspect I am. It’s the deburring. It puts a lot of pressure on the center of my palm and I think it’s the cause of a loss of sensitivity in my fingers in the last couple of...

        Yesterday… I tried to decipher the plans and figure out how all the inboard spar pieces fit together. In my head I had expected the spar to be just one or two long pieces of beefy metal. Not so. There’s got to be thirty pieces or so. Once assembled they...
