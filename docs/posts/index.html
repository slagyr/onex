        </h2>
        Wings Attached Attaching the wings required some special tools; reamers. These are like drill bits that make very precise sized holes. I had ordered them from Amazon but one was the wrong size. Fortunately Denny Myrick had them from his build and let me borrow it. There are basically two...

        The engine is pretty well tuned at this point. All the squawks have been addressed and were not necessarily what I suspected. RPMs Swapping the RPM sensor lead to the other side of the Voltage regulator did the trick. Alternator Output I wired up some extentions to the alternator and...
