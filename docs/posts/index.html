        Summer was awesome but it’s time to get back to work. Oshkosh 2017 Luka and I flew up to Oshkosh on Sunday and camped next to the airplane. What a great time. We saw plenty of aircraft, of course. For the first time I was able to attend lots of...

        </h2>
        Yesterday I finished the canopy. See below. It’s… okay. I’m not thrilled with how it turned out, but it’s good enough that I don’t feel the need to redo it. My main gripe is that there’s two spots where it bows up, not fitting flush with the edges. On the...

        With the canopy roughly cut to size, I decided my best stratefy would be to cleco it to the frame. This was a commitment because I couldn’t move the holes I had to drill. Even though I couldn’t figure out if the canopy was the right size or shape, I...

        </h2>
        Last week we were on vacation which was great. In the mean time, all the parts I ordered were delivered and waiting for me. So I continued with the canopy. The frame was not too bad. Cutting the canopy has been hard. I’m worried that if I screw up too...

        So OnexMike’s technique didn’t work for me. I lined up the bow with the template and pounded it with the rubber hammer and nothing happened except a lot of bouncing. I’m not sure how he got it to work. No problem. I had a plan “B” which was to make...
