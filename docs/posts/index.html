        Cowling It took a great deal of time and care to get the cowling cut nicely. Once it fit well, I added the camlocks (from an Aeroward kit) to fasten the top cowling to the bottom. The seams between the two halves were crooked (unavoidably) and I couldn’t leave it...

        In the past week, I started on several tasks, unable to complete any for various reasons. However, much progress has been made. Sonex Build Visits Last Thursday I went to visit Denny and Jim at Deer Valley airport to check out their builds. It’s always fruitful to see how other...

        I received all the avionics from Dynon. That’s exciting. It’s also exciting having the engine mounted. But it’s all overwhelming. There’s so many questions: What are all the parts that need to be mounted to the firewall? Where do I put them all? How many things go on the panel...

        Engine Mounting The engine is mounted! I recruited some help; specifically my friend Rob, my son Luka and his friends Caleb and David. They were off to a high school football game so their friends Siri, Kayla, and Elly were over to eat first and car pool. I had more...

        Flaps Handle Installed this yesterday. Nothing much of interest to report. I decided not to connect the rods so they wouldn’t get in the way when I work on the wings. Elevator Trim The elevator trim arrived right when I finished the flaps. The cable has to be routed from...
