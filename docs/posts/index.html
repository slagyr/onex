        I received all the avionics from Dynon. That’s exciting. It’s also exciting having the engine mounted. But it’s all overwhelming. There’s so many questions: What are all the parts that need to be mounted to the firewall? Where do I put them all? How many things go on the panel...

        Engine Mounting The engine is mounted! I recruited some help; specifically my friend Rob, my son Luka and his friends Caleb and David. They were off to a high school football game so their friends Siri, Kayla, and Elly were over to eat first and car pool. I had more...

        Flaps Handle Installed this yesterday. Nothing much of interest to report. I decided not to connect the rods so they wouldn’t get in the way when I work on the wings. Elevator Trim The elevator trim arrived right when I finished the flaps. The cable has to be routed from...

        Primary activity today: filing sheet metal holes. I’ll explain. Next up on the controls was the control stick and elevator rods. The control stick mounts on the front side of the main spar with the stick right in the middle. I was trying to figure out where to drill the...

        Avionics Research Denny was kind enough to let me visit his build again and ask questions about avionics. After doing research at Oshkosh and on the web, I’ve decided to go with Dynon Avionics in a very similar configuration to Denny. But there are hundreds of questions I had about...
