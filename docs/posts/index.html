        Primary activity today: filing sheet metal holes. I’ll explain. Next up on the controls was the control stick and elevator rods. The control stick mounts on the front side of the main spar with the stick right in the middle. I was trying to figure out where to drill the...

        Avionics Research Denny was kind enough to let me visit his build again and ask questions about avionics. After doing research at Oshkosh and on the web, I’ve decided to go with Dynon Avionics in a very similar configuration to Denny. But there are hundreds of questions I had about...

        As Hannah and Rob (family friends) walked by the garage last week as I was fabricating brake parts, we chatted and I mentioned that I didn’t know exactly how to install hydraulic brakes. It turns out that Hannah’s dad (Vic) was coming to town. He’s handy with cars and knows...

        Controls Parts Continuing with the controls, I started with the flaps. Missing hardware prevented me from fastening the control stick to the mounting rod. So I moved on to the aileron/stabilizer control and got the stick attached. Then on to some pulleys, mounting brackets, and most everything required to put...
