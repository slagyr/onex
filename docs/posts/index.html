        </h2>
        The engine is pretty well tuned at this point. All the squawks have been addressed and were not necessarily what I suspected. RPMs Swapping the RPM sensor lead to the other side of the Voltage regulator did the trick. Alternator Output I wired up some extentions to the alternator and...

        Fired up the engine for the first time today. Below there’s a video of the event recorded by my son Luka. Preparation Adding fuel 1/2 gallons at a time, I marked the fuel level on the tank up to 3 gallons. Sitting in the plane, I can only see up...

        </h2>
        Lots of little things done this past week, however the most consuming task was measuring fuel flow. Most experimental aircraft accidents occur in the first few hours of flight due to fuel flow problems. So it’s important to test it. Here’s how it works. Convention says that an engine needs...

        Lo and behold… after five+ days of wiring, when I turned on the master switch for the first time, the avionics came alive! The prep work I did, planning and drawing the electrical schematic, was invaluable. The actually wiring, although detailed and time consuming, wasn’t as hard as I feared....

        Chaos! So many components. So many wires. So little room. Cutting our the instrument panel was not as bad as I feared. The only tools I required was the Dremmel cutting wheel, drill bits, and files. I think it turned out simple and quite user friendly. That carbon fiber vinyl...
