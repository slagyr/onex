        Oil Separator My kit came with an oil separator, the black cylinder attached to the firewall. It’s possible I added it to my order as an extra because many other builders don’t seem to have one. As I understand, it minimizes loss of oil, especially when flying inverted. Any oil,...

        Engine Baffles

I hope I never have to build engine baffles again.  ‘Nuf said.



The K&amp;N RC-1980 air filter seems to do the trick.  It attaches with a simple ring clamp and can be installed in such a manner so as to not interfere with the cowling.

        Exhaust The kit exhaust pipes are longer than needed. They rest at an angle and I thought it’d look good to have them parallel with the fuselage, yet sticking out a bit to make sure the exhaust exits cleanly. The cut line was a bit trikcy to get right, and...

        Cowling It took a great deal of time and care to get the cowling cut nicely. Once it fit well, I added the camlocks (from an Aeroward kit) to fasten the top cowling to the bottom. The seams between the two halves were crooked (unavoidably) and I couldn’t leave it...

        In the past week, I started on several tasks, unable to complete any for various reasons. However, much progress has been made. Sonex Build Visits Last Thursday I went to visit Denny and Jim at Deer Valley airport to check out their builds. It’s always fruitful to see how other...
