        Three trips to the hardware store today. The first was to Ace to get a thread tap to make a threaded hole in the bellcrannk faces. Those are done. They’re for translating control inputs from the inside part of the wing to the outside, and they’re pretty nifty. Remeber the...

        My wonderful wife helped me today! Together we installed the main landing gear. It was a two man job. I got on my creeper under the plane to drill and install the bolts, while she handed me the bits and put on the nuts from above. What’s gonna work? Team...

        On to a task for which I have the parts: the main gear. Based on advise from fellow Sonex builders I upgraded the brakes to Sonex’s AeroConversion hydraulics. The first pic shows the intimidating amount of parts for the brakes. To my surprise, it all came together quite simply. So...

        Blog Improvements I’llbe the first to adminst that navigating this blog has been burdensome. So I added some Next/Previous links to each page. And the home page was getting VERY long, transferring far more bits than needed. So I paginated the blog listing. This blog runs on GitHub Pages using...

        I wish I had enough interesting information to blog every day, but despite the last 17 hours of effort over the last two days, I’ve only got one new picture for you. This is the fuselage box all updrilled, deburred, and ready to rivet/bolt. Lots of bolts are called out...
