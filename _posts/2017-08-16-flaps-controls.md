#### Flaps Handle

Installed this yesterday.  Nothing much of interest to report.  I decided not to connect the rods so they wouldn't get in the way when I work on the wings.

#### Elevator Trim

The elevator trim arrived right when I finished the flaps. The cable has to be routed from the instrument panel to behind the trim lever where the two rods meet.  After considering my options, I drilled some holes in the side fuselage beams, stuck some rubber gromets in there and rand the cable.  I think it looks decent.

These springs hold the elevator in a neutral position, and they're connected to trim cable on the right side of the picture.  I'll have to reconfigure the wire tension when I figure out where the trim knob will be mounted.  And I realized that my forward spring hole won't work since the rear spar has to go there.  So I'll relocate that.
