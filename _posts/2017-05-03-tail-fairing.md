I'm not at all pleased with the way the tail panels came out.  See the first picture.  They required lots of bending to make them fit. It was non-trivial and I think I did a poor job.  This became an opportunity to try out some composite technique.
    
First was the play-dough, err modelling clay.  You can see a rough fill of the corners.  I left the panels in to give a shape to work around but they'll go when it's done.  Then I smoothed out the clay and removed the excess.  I've never sculpted much so this took a couple hours.
    
Since I was using the body of the plane as a mold, I had to take precautions to make sure the epoxy doesn't stick to the plane.  This fairing will be removable so there's access to the tail section.  I feared the epoxy would go everywhere and glue the plane in terrible ways.  So I took double precautions.  Mirror Wax, and Silicon spray. Both are mold release agents.  I really hope they do the job.  

I cut the fiberglass and peel pry.  Weighed it, and started mixing the epoxy.  Layer by layer I laid out the material and wetted it.  The glass is quite capable of handing the curves but the peel pry, not so much.  If I had to do it again, I'd cut small pieces to better fit the mold.  This was using one piece per layer.

While that sets, I bolted the engine mount and fabricated some parts for the wing fold assembly.
