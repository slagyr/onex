Summer was awesome but it's time to get back to work.

#### Oshkosh 2017 

Luka and I flew up to Oshkosh on Sunday and camped next to the airplane. What a great time. We saw plenty of aircraft, of course.  For the first time I was able to attend lots of forums from which I learned a ton.  The Barenaked Ladies performed a great show on Monday.  But my favorite part was checking out all the homebuilds.  There's soooo much variety!  And I was not previously aware how much influence Burt Rutan had on the homebuild world.  His designs are wonderfully unique and I love the canard style.  Now I'm thinking my next build will be a Long EZ, Cozy, or something like that.

Luka and I headed home Wednesday but we didn't get enough so we drove back with my dad on Thursday.  There was still so much to see!

#### Sonex Tour

At last I got to see Sonex's home, and meet so many Sonex people that I'd been talking to on the phone.  We even got to go on a tour of their campus.  Great time.  What's more, I got to check out a bunch of other Sonex builds that people brought to the show.  I was very curious to see how poor my work stood up to these experienced builders.  But I'm happy to admit that my workmanship stood its ground with the best of them... so far.

####  Hydraulic Brakes

Before starting the wings, I figure I should take advantage of the easy access to the cockpit and install controls.  So I started on the brakes.  Below is all that parts I fabricated for the brakes but I'm waiting on a bunch of hardware to finish the install.

#### Access Panels

This was just an easy task I was able to knock out.  The plans call for machine screws that thread into the skins.  I felt better using nut plates.  It took a bit longer but should hold up better over time.
