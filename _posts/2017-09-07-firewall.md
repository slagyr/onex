#### Exhaust

The kit exhaust pipes are longer than needed.  They rest at an angle and I thought it'd look good to have them parallel with the fuselage, yet sticking out a bit to make sure the exhaust exits cleanly.  The cut line was a bit trikcy to get right, and then cutting with the grinding wheel was an experience that reminded me of the Orange County Choppers show where they fabricated choppers.

#### Firewall

To the firewall I added the ignitions, oil seperator, and battery (exact location still pending).  There's still a few things to add but there should be plenty of room.

### Baffles

After hiking this morning with Angelique, I had a bit of energy the afternoon to get started on the baffles for the engine.  Sonex provided a lazer but kit, but the fit is rough there's plenty of modifications to be made.  These baffles feel a bit hackish.
