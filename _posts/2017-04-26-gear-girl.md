My wonderful wife helped me today!  Together we installed the main landing gear.  It was a two man job.  I got on my creeper under the plane to drill and install the bolts, while she handed me the bits and put on the nuts from above.  What's gonna work?  Team work!  

Afterward she had to go.  So I tried to figure out what I could work on next, while wating for parts to be delivered.  I decided the engine mount would be simple.  Alas, the bolts are missing from that hardware kit.  Sigh.  I ordered them and started working on the bellcrank, the interesting mechanism that translate controls between the wing segments were they fold.  For today, I got a bunch of angle parts fabricated.
