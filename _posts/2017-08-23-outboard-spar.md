I received all the avionics from Dynon.  That's exciting.  It's also exciting having the engine mounted.  But it's all overwhelming.  There's so many questions:
 * What are all the parts that need to be mounted to the firewall?  Where do I put them all?
 * How many things go on the panel and what the best way to lay it out?
 * Where do all the fuel system components go?
 * Oil system?
 * Electrical system?
 
There were a few things I could easily attach to the engine.  
 * Oil cooler
 * Mufflers
 * Starter
 * Spark plugs
 
I did these on Monday (after watching the eclipse) and they can all be seen in the picture below.

I'm hoping that [Aircraft Wiring Guide by Marc Ausman](http://www.aircraftwiringguide.com/) book that I ordered from Lulu will help answer many of the questions.  It should arrive tomorrow.  I've also got an appointment to visit two other Sonex builders tomorrow morning, Denny Smith and Jim Armstrong.  I'm hoping I can get answers to my remaining questions from them and their builds.

In the mean time, yesterday and today I worked on the outboard spars.  These are the main supports for the outer parts of the wings that fold up.  These were a little easier than the main spar but my experience allowed me to complete them much faster.  Bucking rivets is exhausting so I quite a bit earlier than normal today.
