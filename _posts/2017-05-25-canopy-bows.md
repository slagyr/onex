So [OnexMike's technique](http://www.onexmike.org/canopy.html) didn't work for me.  I lined up the bow with the template and pounded it with the rubber hammer and nothing happened except a lot of bouncing.  I'm not sure how he got it to work.  No problem.  I had a plan "B" which was to make a bending break.  That worked well.  Though it was a bit of a puzzle to figure out where exactly the bends were needed.

Kerry, Sonex support, insists that all my missing parts are my responsibility.  Oh well.  My solutions:
   
 * Canopy Latch Handle:  I made one today with some extra aluminum angle
 * Phenolic (plastic) for latch wear plate:  I tested the windshield plastic and found it to be very similar in strength and texture, So I used that instead.  See picture below.
 * Square tube: Used for the sides of the canopy frame.  Funny enough, the kit included enough of this to make one side, but not enough to make both.  I ordered more.
 * Round tube: Used to make cross brace on back of canopy.  I ordered extra square tube for this.
 
The picture below shows the rear latch wear plate that I installed.  Some extra aluminum spacers were added to remove some of the slack.  Sadly, the front wear plate wouldn't fit because the throttle mount is in the way.  I had to cut it in half and use only one bolt to attach it.  Not sure how the plans missed this.
