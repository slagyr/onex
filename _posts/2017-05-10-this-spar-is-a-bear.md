Yesterday... I tried to decipher the plans and figure out how all the inboard spar pieces fit together.  In my head I had expected the spar to be just one or two long pieces of beefy metal.  Not so.  There's got to be thirty pieces or so.  Once assembled they essentially form one long beefy chunk of metal, but with intricacies.  
  
I emailed Kerry and asked for pictures to help be understand.  He sent me some, but what really helped what a [blog from a guy I know as Onex Mike](http://www.onexmike.org/spar--inboard.html).  This spelled it out for me with just the right pictures.  Thank Mike!
 
Onces that was figured out, I had to drill holes in all the ribs, beams, supports and other stuff.  I finally finished today.  The shear quantity of material in this spar multiplies the work.  I'll sheepishly admit that I thought I'd be done with the spar in a day or so.  Oh well.  One step after another. The picture below is the clecoed spar ready to updrill.
