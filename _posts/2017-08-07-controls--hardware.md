#### Controls Parts

Continuing with the controls, I started with the flaps.  Missing hardware prevented me from fastening the control stick to the mounting rod.  So I moved on to the aileron/stabilizer control and got the stick attached.  Then on to some pulleys, mounting brackets, and most everything required to put it on the fuselage.

#### Hardware
     
I've complained about missing hardware a million times and I apologize.  We're both fed up.  And the $6 shipping cost each time I order a couple bolts or nuts has been adding up.  Enough!  Today I spent several hours listing all the hardware call-outs in the plans (the pages I've yet to work on), taking inventory of the hardware I have on hand, and made a list of what's missing.  $130 on Aircraft Spruce... Keep in mind that most nuts, bolts, washers, etc cost a few cents.  That should give you an idea of how much hardware is missing.  

Despite the nice presentation of [WB Parts OneX Hardware Kit](http://www.sonexaircraft.com/eshop/cart.php?target=product&product_id=17532&category_id=441), it is _severely_ lacking.  If you're gonna build a OneX, I'd seriously consider [AirWard's Hardware Kit](http://www.airward.com/amelia/search.asp?advnav=&action=Search&store=&cat=10000748&subcat_10000013=10000748&ShowImages=&ShowDetails=&menuID=882~882&id=885).  It can't be worse than WB's kit; that's for sure. And I've been very pleased with AirWard's other kits in addition to their service.  When you email them, you get a response from Dave WARD.  Can't beat that.
