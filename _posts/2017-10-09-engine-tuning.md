The engine is pretty well tuned at this point.  All the squawks have been addressed and were not necessarily what I suspected.

#### RPMs

Swapping the RPM sensor lead to the other side of the Voltage regulator did the trick.

#### Alternator Output

I wired up some extentions to the alternator and voltage regulator leads so I could measure with a voltmeter while I sat in the cockpit.  All signals are good.  Alternator is generating high voltage and the regulator is regulating.  I found that output is not great at the low RPMs at which I was initially running the engine.  When I got above 2,000 RPM, the alternator output was much more reasonable.

#### Ignition

The ignition timing needed adjusting.  Once I centered it, the engine ran MUCH smoother.  Currently I get about a 60-70 RPM drop when I turn off the magnetos and/or ignition.  Fine tuning is needed, but I may need to get in the air to figure out whether I need to retard or advance the timing.  Or maybe my mechanic will be able to tell on the ground.

#### Unsteady RPMs

This, I found, was a result of vibrations moving the throttle.  Tightening the friction solved the problem.

#### Oil Leaks

Finding the exact source of the leaks was not easy.  I tightened and resealed many parts before I found the actual source.  No more oil seeps out of the engine now.

#### Wing Ribs

Work on the wings resumes.  I attached the inboard wing ribs to the spar.  Am working on the wing fold ribs which are quite involved.  I had started these months ago but put them on hold.  Now I have a much clearer idea of how they fit in.
