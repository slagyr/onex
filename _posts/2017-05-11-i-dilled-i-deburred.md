I drilled.  I deburred.  I got a repetitive stress injury.  At least I suspect I am.  It's the deburring.  It puts a lot of pressure on the center of my palm and I think it's the cause of a loss of sensitivity in my fingers in the last couple of months.  
     
Below is the spar, well most of it, all drilled and ready for deburring.     
     
Perhaps tomorrow I'll get to solid rivets.
