Yesterday I finished the canopy.  See below.  It's... okay.  I'm not thrilled with how it turned out, but it's good enough that I don't feel the need to redo it.  My main gripe is that there's two spots where it bows up, not fitting flush with the edges.  On the front edge, there's a gap where air will certainly flood into the cockpit.  This I ameliorated with some foam tape which fills the gap and makes a good seal all around.  On the rear gap, well I'll have to revisit that later.

With the canopy done, I wanted to tidy up some loose ends before summer break.  One item was the fuel tank refill hole that is cut in the wind shield.  You may remember that Sonex provided a 5" aluminum disk to cover the hole and eclipse the pilots vision!?  And I had purchased a clear cover kit from AirWard.  I installed that.  It's much nicer.

Then I removed the canopy, windshield, and glare shield.  Now I'll have access to work on controls, wings, fuel system, power system, and electronics when I return from summer break.  The bird is looking bare again.
